<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I was a little girl, my favorite books
dealt with children whose lives were like my
own. I smudged with many readings the
pages that told of Susy and Prudy and Dotty
in Portland, of their visits to the country, of
their every-day happenings. Their adventures
were far dearer to me than those of foreign
lads and lasses and richly clad little princesses
whose ways were not as my ways.</p>

<p>I have thought for some time that the colored
children in the United States might also like
to have their intimate books telling of happenings
that were like their own. They must be tired
of reading always of far-away children. So,
out of my years of experience among these
soft-eyed, velvet-cheeked small friends, I have
written this story.</p>

<p>I have purposely avoided dialect. Correct
English spelling is difficult enough to young
readers without superimposing other forms for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
the not too-familiar words. I have, however,
tried to give the turn of expression in the
southern speech.</p>

<p>I hope my colored child friends will smudge
my pages. And if the white child stops to
read, I trust that she will feel an awakened
sympathy for the dark-faced boys and girls
whose world is outside her own.</p>

<small>THE QUEEN OF SHEBA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was raining, and Hazel Tyler had not
been allowed to go out all day. As she sat
looking out of her window into the narrow
Boston street she would have made a pretty
picture but for the woe-begone expression on
her brown face. Her hair was soft and curly,
her eyes dark and clear, her mouth full, but
delicate. Usually it was happy in expression;
but this afternoon it drooped at the corners.
Four o&#8217;clock! Two hours more before supper.
Oh, this stupid, stupid Saturday!</p>

<p>She got up and walked from the tiny parlor,
where she had been sitting, into a tiny bedroom
where a large baby doll lay on the bed she
and her mother shared. Hazel took the doll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
up, shook it severely, and put it down again.
She was growing to care very little for dolls;
they were not warm and dimpled and you had
to do all the talking for them. She left the
tiny bedroom and stepped into a tiny kitchen
thus making the tour of the apartment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; she said to a slender woman
who stood at an ironing-board, &#8220;may I go
around and play with the McGinnis&#8217;s baby?
It&#8217;s such a little way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Tyler looked up. Her face like Hazel&#8217;s
was gentle and delicate, but the features were
finer and the skin lighter in shade. She was
ironing an elaborate pink tea gown, and she
seemed ill-fitted for such taxing work.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Hazel,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I&#8217;ve told you
that you can&#8217;t go out in the rain while you have
a cold. There is no use in teasing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel knew this to be true, and for a time
was silent, watching her mother. She ran her
slender finger along the tucks of the pink
gown.</p>

<p>&#8220;What pretty clothes Mrs. Hollingsworth
always has,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I wish I could have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
something pretty. I&#8217;ve nothing to wear but
this blue serge.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel&#8217;s mother looked at her a second and
the child felt abashed. She knew very well
that since her father&#8217;s death&mdash;her dear, dear
father&mdash;her mother had had to support them
both, and how hard she had worked at whatever
would bring in money&mdash;at sewing, hairdressing,
and even this tiring laundry. She
knew, too, that when the rent was paid, and the
grocer&#8217;s and butcher&#8217;s bills settled, the little
money left went first to her and her wants.
Why, only last week she had had pretty hair
ribbons; and her mother&#8217;s black dress was
growing shabby. She bent over and kissed
the hand that was patting the pink wrapper
into place.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go into the parlor and make my picture-puzzle,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, dear,&#8221; Mrs. Tyler answered.</p>

<p>The little girl worked for a time at the elaborate
puzzle spread out on the parlor table;
but its green trees were perplexing, and she
soon returned to the kitchen to find the pink<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
dress finished and on the top of a pile of speckless
linen in the laundry basket. Her mother
stood with hat and coat on.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to run out to make sure that
John comes to-night to get the clothes,&#8221; Mrs.
Tyler said. &#8220;Now, don&#8217;t look so woe-begone,
dear. I&#8217;ll cook waffles for supper, and we&#8217;ll
have the maple syrup that Mrs. Brown brought
us from the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel&#8217;s face brightened. &#8220;May we eat off
the pretty china?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you may set the table with it when I
get back.&#8221; And Mrs. Tyler went out into the
narrow hall, down the dark stairs and into
the narrow street.</p>

<p>She could hardly have reached the corner
when Hazel heard a knock at the door, and
opened it to a little black girl who at once
stepped gaily into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where you been all day, Hazel?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>She was a jolly little girl of ten, a year younger
than Hazel, with plump arms and legs and a
sturdy body. Her crinkly hair was tied with
a bright red ribbon, and she wore a gay bandanna<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
about her neck. Her black eyes shone
with good will.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do, Charity?&#8221; Hazel said, a
little hesitatingly.</p>

<p>She liked this new neighbor and had played
with her the rare afternoons that she had been
allowed on the street; but she knew her mother
scarcely approved of Charity. But then her
mother did not approve of any of the girls
and boys on Hammond Street and one must
play with some one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother&#8217;s out,&#8221; said Charity. &#8220;I
know, for I saw her go. Where you been all
day, Hazel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here at home,&#8221; Hazel answered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got a sore throat, and I&#8217;m not allowed to go
out, and there&#8217;s nothing to do in this poky
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s play,&#8221; said Charity, &#8220;you shut your
eyes and I&#8217;ll hide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh,&#8221; Hazel replied contemptuously, &#8220;you
know, Charity, there isn&#8217;t a single place here
big enough for a cat to hide in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s,&#8221; Charity looked about for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
inspiration, and her glance fell on the doll in
the adjoining room, &#8220;let&#8217;s play house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you would just beat the baby. Let&#8217;s
play a new game, something brand new that we
never played before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charity began jumping about on one foot,
and on into the little parlor, but she had no
suggestion to offer. Hazel followed her and
as her eye fell on the family Bible, her face
lighted with excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; she declared, &#8220;let&#8217;s play a Bible
game. Let&#8217;s act a Bible story the way we act
history at school.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charity stood on her two feet. &#8220;George
Washington?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not George Washington, but like that.
A Bible story. We can&#8217;t be Joseph and his
Brethren,&#8221; Hazel went on musing, &#8220;there&#8217;re
too many of them. I don&#8217;t like Jacob&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be King Solomon,&#8221; Charity exclaimed
quite suddenly.</p>

<p>She sat in the arm chair and held herself
erect. Taking her bandanna she wreathed it
in a turban about her head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s splendid, Charity,&#8221; Hazel said
heartily. &#8220;That&#8217;s your crown and you&#8217;re
sitting on your throne. Now who shall
I be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You? Why, of course, you&#8217;ll be the Queen
of Sheba.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel laughed gleefully. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be a real
queen, won&#8217;t I? What&#8217;ll I do, Charity?&#8221; Her
friend&#8217;s knowledge of Bible history was evidently
greater than her own.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ask me questions,&#8221; Charity explained,
&#8220;all sorts of questions, and I answer them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what do I wear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me recollect.&#8221; Charity shut her eyes
to think the harder. &#8220;The Queen of Sheba
she come to Jerusalem, with, with a very great
<i>train</i>. You must wear a train, Hazel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t a thing with a train here,&#8221;
Hazel replied mournfully.</p>

<p>Looking into the kitchen her eyes fell upon
the laundry basket with the pink dress on top.
&#8220;I could borrow Mrs. Hollingsworth&#8217;s tea
gown,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Now Charity might make slips in grammar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
and slap unoffending dolls, but the laundry
was sacred to her. Once the pile of muslin
was ironed and placed in the basket it was
not to be tampered with.</p>

<p>&#8220;You daren&#8217;t,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Hazel walked into the other room, took the
pink wrapper and slowly put it on. Her
heart beat fast and her fingers trembled, but
she fastened the dress at the throat and held
it up about her. Entering the parlor she
went to the chair in which King Solomon sat,
and bowed low, dropping the pink dress so
that it trailed upon the floor. Then she
looked up into the king&#8217;s dark face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this a royal great train?&#8221; she said
softly.</p>

<p>King Solomon nodded. He was saying to
himself, &#8220;You bet, my mother needn&#8217;t say
she&#8217;s such a good little girl again!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Queen of Sheba bowed once more.
&#8220;What do I do next, Charity?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ask me questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think of any;&#8221; and the queen, like
Alice in Through the Looking Glass, courtesied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
again to help her think. &#8220;What did I have
for dinner?&#8221; she said at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Myrrh and mint and jasper and honey
and the honeycomb.&#8221;</p>

<p>The queen looked up in admiration. &#8220;That&#8217;s
a beautiful answer; how did you think of all
those things? But is jasper something to
eat?&#8221;</p>

<p>King Solomon did not regard the question.
&#8220;Ask me something else?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&mdash;what&mdash;what did I have for breakfast?&#8221;</p>

<p>The king stuck out his tongue derisively.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you think of a single thing, Hazel
Tyler, but food?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel felt her lack of originality. &#8220;Have
you had pleasant weather this past week in
Jerusalem?&#8221; she asked politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has rained,&#8221; replied King Solomon,
&#8220;for forty days and nights; and great was the
fall thereof.&#8221;</p>

<p>The king&#8217;s answers were so much more
impressive than the queen&#8217;s questions that
Hazel sought for first place.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>&#8220;Now I shall dance before the king,&#8221; she
said, and began slowly advancing and receding
before King Solomon&#8217;s throne, holding up the
pink dress as she moved. She looked very
pretty and graceful as she made her low courtesies
and King Solomon&#8217;s eyes gleamed
approbation.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you like a me, as I like a you,&#8221; he began
to sing and the Queen of Sheba stepped in a
little livelier fashion toward the kitchen door.
&#8220;&#8217;Cause I love you,&#8221; he went on, and the
little queen danced before him over the door-sill
and into the kitchen where she struck
against the table and fell in a heap upon the
floor.</p>

<p>The singing stopped. Charity stooped to
where Hazel sat, a frightened heap. She
examined the pink gown. It had a black
smudge on the back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have to be done all over again,&#8221; said
Charity briefly.</p>

<p>Hazel rose and took the dress off. Her lip
quivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d best go home,&#8221; said Charity. &#8220;There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
ain&#8217;t nothing I can do. Oh, Hazel won&#8217;t you
catch it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother never whips me,&#8221; said Hazel
sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;She ain&#8217;t like mine,&#8221; said Charity.</p>

<p>The bandanna was off King Solomon&#8217;s head
and he crept out of the door and down the
stairs to his home.</p>

<p>The Queen of Sheba sat on the kitchen chair
with the soiled dress on her lap. Like the queen
of old, &#8220;there was no more spirit in her.&#8221;
She remained quite still two, three, five minutes.
Then she heard her mother knock.</p>

<p>She opened the door, the dress in her hand,
and showed the spot without speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did it happen?&#8221; Mrs. Tyler asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was playing with Charity. It wasn&#8217;t
her fault,&#8221; hastily, &#8220;she told me not to touch
it, but I was the Queen of Sheba and I wanted
a train. Will it have to be done all over,
Mother? Charity said it would have to be
done all over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it will,&#8221; said Mrs. Tyler, and turned
to the tub where she began to draw water.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>&#8220;You must go to bed, Hazel,&#8221; she said sternly.
&#8220;Later I will bring you a supper of bread and
milk.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the little girl lay in bed, she could hear
her mother rub, rubbing the dress against the
wash-board. Then that sound ceased, and the
door of the refrigerator was opened and shut.
She silently ate the bread and milk brought
her. No jolly time together at the table over
the waffles and maple syrup and the pretty
flowered plates! She heard her mother&#8217;s tired
footsteps moving from ironing-board to stove
and back to ironing-board, and she noted the
click of the iron as it fell upon the metal
holder. She could almost count each movement
up and down the waist and the long
skirt.</p>

<p>At length John came. He was kept waiting
a few minutes. Then the basket was handed
him, the outer door closed, and the long day&#8217;s
work was done.</p>

<p>Hazel stole out of bed into the kitchen where
her mother sat. She put her arms about her
neck and kissed her again and again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry,&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>Her mother kissed back and held her close.</p>

<p>&#8220;It does seem, Mother dear,&#8221; Hazel said
at length, &#8220;as though, ever since we came
to this place, I couldn&#8217;t have the least bit of
fun without making such a lot of trouble.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>HEALTH AND A DAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sky was washed the clear blue of late
November the next morning, and Hazel could
count the few little white clouds floating on
it as she walked to church. The cold, fresh
air quickened her blood and made her want
to skip and dance, but she stayed demurely
at her mother&#8217;s side. They soon left their
dingy street and turned into a well-to-do
neighborhood where white people lived, and
then went on with the white people into a large
church. The usher nodded pleasantly to them,
and they took a pew to the left, half way up
the aisle. Here they sat in silence while the
organ played its solemn, spiritual music.</p>

<p>As she listened to the music the anxious look,
that was usually present, left Mrs. Tyler&#8217;s
face. This was her dear and holy place where
her mother and her mother&#8217;s mother had worshipped.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
As a little girl she had known its
first minister&mdash;the noble, courageous citizen who
had never failed to plead for the freedom of
the slave. After her marriage with her southern
husband she had gone a few times to listen
to the big-hearted oratory at the colored church;
but the service there did not touch her spirit,
and she and her husband had agreed on Sunday
mornings to worship in different places the
same Heavenly Father. Hazel had always
accompanied her mother, and she was quite at
home among the white people. More than
one greeted her with a smile.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;My heart is resting, oh, my God,</div>
<div class="indent">My heart is in Thy care,&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>sang the congregation.</p>

<p>Hazel loved this hymn. She joined in the
singing with her clear child&#8217;s voice. She always
loved the hymns, and she even loved the sermon,
for was not the minister her dear friend?
When the sermon was finished there was the
five cents to be dropped into the contribution
plate, and there was the beautiful benediction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
at the end of the service asking that the peace
of God abide in her heart. &#8220;Amen,&#8221; sang the
choir, and the organ pealed that the service
was over.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do, Hazel?&#8221; the lady behind
her asked. &#8220;She seems a little peaked, doesn&#8217;t
she?&#8221; addressing the mother.</p>

<p>The anxious look returned to Mrs. Tyler&#8217;s
face. &#8220;She hasn&#8217;t been very well,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep her in the fresh air as much as you
can, though I know that that is difficult to do
in cold weather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do, Hazel?&#8221; &#8220;How do you
do, Mrs. Tyler?&#8221; came from many sides as
the two walked from the church into the street.</p>

<p>Their Sunday dinner was to be eaten with
their old friends, the Perkins, who lived in
Jamaica Plains. As their car stopped, Hazel
fairly raced down the street where she had
spent her life until her father&#8217;s death, and
turned up the steps of a pleasant cottage, and
almost into the arms of a big, smiling black
man. He carried her off at once, leaving Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Tyler to be ministered to by his young, bright-faced
wife. The two visitors were evidently
at home.</p>

<p>The dinner was a lavish one, beginning with
turkey and ending with ice-cream. Mr. Perkins
heaped Hazel&#8217;s plate, urging her to eat.
But though these were her favorite dishes
her appetite was small. He encouraged her
to tell him of her doings, of how well she ranked
at school. &#8220;Right at the top, Hazel; you
know you are going to college.&#8221; He asked how
she liked the new story he had given her,
&#8220;The Jungle Book.&#8221; After dinner was over
he took her to his study across the hall from
the parlor where the two women sat.</p>

<p>&#8220;How Henry loves children,&#8221; Mrs. Tyler
said to her friend. Mrs. Perkins nodded. Behind
where she sat, was the picture of the only
child born to her and her husband, the child
whom they had lost five years ago. She knew
how his hungry heart went out to this little girl.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tyler faced the picture. She had loved
the child and mothered her. A lump rose in
her throat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>&#8220;Sarah,&#8221; she said, laying her hand on her
friend&#8217;s arm, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to talk with you about
Hazel. I&#8217;m worried, I&#8217;m worried.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hazel, why hasn&#8217;t she been well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, all this autumn she has seemed so
delicate. She takes cold easily and she doesn&#8217;t
throw it off. I fear the long winter for
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you hadn&#8217;t left Jamaica Plains.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had to. I mustn&#8217;t spend the little money
left me. I must work and save. Hazel will
need more every year. But I don&#8217;t want to
save just for doctor&#8217;s bills. Sometimes, Sarah,
she frightens me. She looks as her father
looked&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Tyler stopped. She could not yet
speak of her husband&#8217;s long illness and of the
blank left by his death.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying this just to complain,&#8221;
she went on after a moment. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a wild idea
that I can&#8217;t keep out of my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Lucy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s to send Hazel for the winter to her
grandmother Tyler&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>&#8220;To Alabama? Oh, Lucy, how could you!
It&#8217;s so far away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, but it&#8217;s a home in a beautiful
place where she could be out-of-doors all day
long. My husband used to tell me about the
good times he had as a boy among the pines
with plenty of space around him. He, like
Hazel, would have hated to have been shut
up in three rooms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s in the South,&#8221; Mrs. Perkins said
earnestly. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know the South, Lucy,
but I fear it with its jim-crow cars and its
lynchings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; gasped Mrs. Tyler. Then, after
a little, she laughed. &#8220;There are thousands
and tens of thousands of colored children who
grow up there in safety. Hazel will be under
good care. Her grandmother will have more
time to give to her than I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has she written for Hazel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not recently, but I know she would welcome
her. She is alone just now, but she is always
mothering some child. She will love Hazel,
for Hazel is like her father in many ways.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
Perhaps living with her grandmother, she will
learn to be still more like him. I cannot bear
the thought of having her leave me, but I
know that if she goes she will be in good hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>A tremendous noise issued from the room
across the hall, and Hazel popped out her head
to call, &#8220;He&#8217;s Shere Khan, a tiger of the jungle,
and I&#8217;m Mowgli.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here and let me eat you, Little Frog,&#8221;
called out the tiger, and made a hideous sound
between a snarl and roar.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Sunday, Henry. Don&#8217;t make so much
noise,&#8221; said his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make so much noise, Shere Khan,&#8221;
said Mowgli, and fearlessly shut herself up
with the tiger in the jungle.</p>

<p>Through the door the two women heard the
little girl cough.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could you get the child South?&#8221; Mrs.
Perkins asked.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i031.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Granny</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>&#8220;Why, oddly enough, one of my neighbors,
Mrs. Graham, is going South in two or three
weeks. She lives at Montgomery, only a couple
of hours by train from Mother Tyler&#8217;s home.
She is a kindly, sensible soul whom Hazel likes.
I can trust the child with her. I dread it,
Sarah,&#8221; and Mrs. Tyler clasped her hands
tightly together, &#8220;I dread it inexpressibly, but
I dread her staying here more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you go with her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be impossible. What could
I do there to earn money? I must stay at
home and work. I&#8217;ve plans for building up a
good business. I feel sure that I can, but it
will take time. Perhaps I shall succeed more
quickly if I put all my energy into my work.
And then Hazel will return in the spring, for
it wouldn&#8217;t be good for her to stay through a
southern summer. If I am busy every minute
I&#8217;m hoping that the time won&#8217;t seem so long.
It will pass quickly if I hear that Hazel gains
in health.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s talking about health?&#8221; asked Mr.
Perkins, as he came out of his room with Hazel
at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; replied Mrs. Tyler.</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember Emerson: &#8216;Give me health
and a day and I will make the pomp of emperors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
ridiculous.&#8217; Lucy, may I take this young
lady out for a walk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely, Henry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel put on her hat and coat and raced off
with her boon companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;She will need a warmer coat,&#8221; Mrs. Tyler
said, and her brow puckered. &#8220;If she stays
here she must have warm clothes and even
then I shall have sometimes to keep her indoors.
She was restless yesterday and naughty, and
that isn&#8217;t like Hazel. Health. That is more
than anything else in the world, isn&#8217;t it? What
shall I do, Sarah?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her friend had risen and was looking at the
picture of her little child.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can only say this Lucy,&#8221; she at length
answered. &#8220;You will never cease to reproach
yourself if anything happens and you haven&#8217;t
done everything possible for Hazel. If a winter
in the South will mean health for her,
then if she is ill you will always regret that
you did not send her away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;People are ill in the South,&#8221; said Mrs. Tyler,
wanting to contradict the advice she sought.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>&#8220;Of course. But you will have done all you
could.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Tyler looked hard at the floor, for a
minute. When she raised her eyes to her
friend&#8217;s they were full of tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t really be living while she&#8217;s away,&#8221;
she said; &#8220;but I&#8217;ll write to mother Tyler
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />


<small>LEAVE TAKING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Hazel first learned that she was to
go away from her mother, she cried bitterly.
But as the preparations for her departure
began, she regained her spirits. Who could
grieve for long in the midst of such excitement?</p>

<p>In the first place, there was the new trunk,
very small and shining.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at it, Charity,&#8221; she said, the afternoon
it came home &#8220;See my initials on the
side, H. T. That stands for Hazel Tyler.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charity looked, and envy entered her heart.
When she visited her granny in Virginia her
clothes were stuffed into a shabby, collapsible
bag.</p>

<p>&#8220;Folks &#8217;ll think you stuck up,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let them,&#8221; answered Hazel. &#8220;This
is a steamer trunk, Charity,&#8221; she went on,
opening it, &#8220;see the cunning tray. When it&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
shut you push it under your berth on the steamer.
I&#8217;m going to have a warm shawl in it to wear
on deck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bet you&#8217;ll be sick,&#8221; said Charity.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she was deeply impressed with
the little trunk, and watched Hazel as day
after day she packed and repacked it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m putting all my clothes in the bottom,
Charity. Mother says for me to take my
summer and my winter clothes both. Here
is my blue gingham, and Mother has let down
my white muslin dress again. Isn&#8217;t it pretty
with the lace and embroidery?&#8221;</p>

<p>Charity sniffed. &#8220;Bet you won&#8217;t wear your
white dress. Folks wear calico down there.
Who&#8217;s going to spend the time washing and
ironing for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel looked a little troubled. &#8220;Why,
Granny, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph, your Granny &#8217;ll be too busy to wait
on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel patted the white dress better in place.
&#8220;I can keep it clean quite a while,&#8221; she
said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>&#8220;See, Charity, the pretty present Mrs. Perkins
gave me,&#8221; she said later, taking a dainty
box from the tray and opening it. &#8220;Six
handkerchiefs and each marked with an &#8216;H.&#8217;
Nobody can take them, can they, because the
&#8216;H&#8217; shows they belong to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charity deliberately took one from the box.
&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ve got one now,&#8221; she declared.</p>

<p>But while she refused to show enthusiasm
regarding Hazel&#8217;s preparations she was really
greatly interested and appeared one day with
something, new to Hazel, in her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a sun-bonnet,&#8221; she explained, holding
it out. &#8220;Everyone wears them down there;
the sun is so hot. Mother and I made it for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s such a pretty pink,&#8221; cried Hazel,
turning it about on her hand. &#8220;Thank you
and your mother so much, Charity,&#8221; and she
kissed her companion.</p>

<p>Charity&#8217;s eyes shone. &#8220;Put it on,&#8221; she
commanded.</p>

<p>The brown face with the soft hair looked very
attractive set in the pink muslin frill. Hazel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
viewed herself in the glass and jumped up
and down with pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like a play to be wearing a sun-bonnet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it off and I&#8217;ll show you how to pack
it.&#8221; And together they put it in the tray.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve another present, Charity,&#8221; Hazel confided,
taking out a small package, and showing
a long, black hair-ribbon. &#8220;It&#8217;s from Miss
Gray, my teacher. Mother says I must count
these presents for Christmas, because I&#8217;ll be
away at Christmas. Perhaps I&#8217;ll put them in
my stocking Christmas eve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! Folks don&#8217;t hang up stockings
South.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Charity, you&#8217;d think they didn&#8217;t
do anything down there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charity cogitated. &#8220;They don&#8217;t do much,&#8221;
she decided, and added a little wistfully, &#8220;it&#8217;s
lots more fun on Hammond Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel slipped her hand in her friend&#8217;s. &#8220;I
wish you were going with me,&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you weren&#8217;t going away,&#8221; Charity
whispered back.</p>

<p>Hazel and her mother had a long discussion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
regarding a suitable present to take to Granny.
Hazel wanted to buy a black and white gingham
dress she saw at Jordan, Marsh&#8217;s; but did
Granny wear a thirty-six like her mother, or
a forty-four, like Charity&#8217;s mamma? Such
uncertainty made the dress impracticable. A
pretty black and white kitten strayed into the
Tyler flat and when Hazel had fed it, and become
attached to it, she felt that it would be a better
present even than the dress. No arguments
concerning the difficulty of carrying a kitten
to Alabama could make her forsake her plan;
only when her mother asked that it be left to
keep her company did Hazel at once give it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, do keep it, Mother dear,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>But still Granny&#8217;s present was unsettled.
Mrs. Perkins unconsciously determined what
it should be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucy,&#8221; she said, one day, &#8220;here is a card
that entitles you to six photographs. You
have a good picture of Hazel, but she has none
of you. Please have them taken immediately
and give the child one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and give one to Granny,&#8221; Hazel said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
And although Mrs. Tyler protested, Granny&#8217;s
present, carefully packed in many rolls of
tissue paper, was her daughter-in-law&#8217;s picture
tastefully framed.</p>

<p>Hazel could not decide, even to the day
of departure, whether she should give it to
Granny on her arrival or should wait until
Christmas.</p>

<p>One day her minister climbed the tenement
stairs and called upon her and her mother.
The trunk was in the parlor and he examined
with deep interest the contents that Hazel
showed him. Especially he admired the pink
sun-bonnet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must wear it to church next summer,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Only I should look at it so much
I might forget to preach my sermon.&#8221;</p>

<p>He encouraged Mrs. Tyler in what she was
doing. &#8220;It will be the making of the child,&#8221;
he assured her. &#8220;I&#8217;ve lived a little in that
country and I know how healthful it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>At parting he placed a package shaped like
a book in Hazel&#8217;s hands. &#8220;This is for Christmas,&#8221;
he said; and taking a pencil from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
pocket, he wrote in big letters, &#8220;Not to be
opened until Christmas.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel gave him a kiss, and holding the book
declared, &#8220;I will keep it sacredly until Christmas.&#8221;</p>

<p>She walked down the stairs with him. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
take good care of my mother at the church,
won&#8217;t you?&#8221; she asked, squeezing his hand,
&#8220;She works so hard. She says she&#8217;s saving
to send me to college, and now I&#8217;ll lose a whole
year at school. It troubles me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it mustn&#8217;t trouble you, little girl,&#8221;
said the minister. They reached the street
and he looked down at her anxious face.
&#8220;We will look after your mother. The
ladies will see that she gets work. That
is the only way that we can help her, for
she will take nothing that she does not
earn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he raised his hat and bade the child
good-bye.</p>

<p>It was nearing the time of departure&mdash;Thursday,
and the ship sailed Saturday. The
trunk was packed for the last time, with Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
Tyler&#8217;s gifts, a box of writing-paper and a
dictionary, on top.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will write me a little every
day, Hazel,&#8221; her mother said. &#8220;It will be
good practice for you. Mail the letters
once or twice a week, but write a little every
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be like a diary,&#8221; said Hazel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll write often to me, Mother,
won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll write often, but you will write without
waiting for an answer. That will be your
gift to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The days were so full that Hazel had not
much time to think of the Southland to which
she was going; but at odd minutes she questioned
what it might be like. She had traveled
no further from Boston than neighboring seashore
resorts, and until her father&#8217;s death she
had seen little of any but refined people, white
or colored.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charity,&#8221; she said, Friday night, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been saying good-bye to the McGinnis&#8217;s baby.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
He is so dear and dimpled and rosy. Are there
many white babies South?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; answered Charity. &#8220;But don&#8217;t you
have nothing to do with white folks. There&#8217;s
two kinds of white folks down there: those
that hates you and those that calls you &#8216;a
cute little nigger.&#8217; My mother says that ain&#8217;t
so, for she knows the first families of Virginia,
but I ain&#8217;t acquainted with &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father used to tell about white people
near his home who were nice,&#8221; said Hazel
reflectively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor white trash, I guess. There ain&#8217;t
any first families in Alabama.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night, before they went to bed, Hazel
questioned her mother about the white folks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t they like me?&#8221; she said. &#8220;Will
they call out &#8216;Nigger,&#8217; the way the boys on
Shawmut Avenue do to Charity?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, dear, I don&#8217;t know. Granny
can help you about that, not I. But I would
not bother with them, Hazel. They go their
way and you go yours. On the steamer, in
the train, at the church and at school&mdash;everywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
you will be separated. Their world
will not be your world. Leave them alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will remember,&#8221; Hazel said softly.</p>

<p>The kind world that she had known seemed
slipping away from her. She held her mother&#8217;s
hand tight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will be with the colored people,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and I will love Granny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when night comes, Hazel, remember
we shall both be saying our prayers to the same
Father in Heaven. I shall ask him to bless
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I to bless you, Mother dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when I look at the stars at night I shall
know that the same stars shine on you, only
you will see the huge heavens and I shall only
see a piece from my city window.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the stars shine on Father, too,&#8221; said
Hazel. &#8220;I think he sees the stars.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this thought she went to bed and,
after a little, fell asleep, but her mother lay
awake the night long.</p>

<p>The last present came as they stood on the
steamer. Mr. Perkins brought it to her and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
demanded and received six hugs in thanks.
It was a soft woolen coat, blue outside and red
within, finer than anything Hazel had ever
owned.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s to keep your heart warm for your old
friend,&#8221; Mr. Perkins said, as he buttoned it
about her. &#8220;Take very good care of her,
Mrs. Graham;&#8221; he spoke earnestly to the
woman at Hazel&#8217;s side. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let her from
your sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be mighty careful,&#8221; Mrs. Graham
answered.</p>

<p>Then the bell rang and visitors were ordered
ashore.</p>

<p>Hazel gave her mother one more kiss. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
be back soon,&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tyler did not try to answer; but her
last look was at a shy, brave little girl in a new
blue coat, going out into an unknown, untried
world.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>THE JOURNEY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity</span> was right. The shawl did not come
out of the trunk until the ship had passed
Cape Hatteras and the voyage was nearly at
an end. Poor Hazel lay in her upper berth,
sick and wretched. When at length she was
able to dress and climb to the deck the rough
weather was over, and she saw a clear, blue
sky and an expanse of soft, tranquil water.
She grew better at once, and ate her dinner
with an appetite.</p>

<p>The landing was wearying, and the long
journey to Alabama in a dirty, ill-ventilated
car was inexpressibly tiring. The child grew
wretchedly weary, and a big lump rose in her
throat when night came on. She was homesick
and uncomfortable. Instead of her pleasant
bed at home, there was only a hard seat on
which to rest. Mrs. Graham pillowed her as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
well as she could, but the sensitive child lay
awake the most of the night: for if she fell
asleep from weariness, a vicious jolt of the train
shook her awake again. Early in the evening
their train stopped to wait until an express
overtook it and passed on ahead. Hazel saw
the Pullman with its comfortable beds and its
brightly-lighted dining car where colored waiters
were serving delicious-looking food to white
people.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t we ride in a car like that?&#8221;
she asked Mrs. Graham.</p>

<p>But she knew the answer before she heard
it. &#8220;Colored people are not allowed to in the
South.&#8221;</p>

<p>All things come to an end, however, even a
wakeful night. In the morning Montgomery
was reached, and at the station Hazel was met
by a kindly colored man who said that his
name was Jenks and that he was a friend of
Granny&#8217;s. He was to look after Hazel and
take her to her grandmother&#8217;s home. So the
little girl bade Mrs. Graham an affectionate
good-bye and went with her new companion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>Mr. Jenks lived in a quiet, country-like
street, and Hazel picked out his house before
they reached it. It had roses growing by the
doorway, and a sweet-faced young woman, like
her mother, stood on the porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re tired out, aren&#8217;t you, honey?&#8221; the
young woman said, giving Hazel a kiss. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t travel again until late afternoon. Come
in and have breakfast, and then lie down and
sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>The biscuit and egg tasted delicious. To
her hostess&#8217;s surprise Hazel refused coffee.
&#8220;My mother doesn&#8217;t want me to drink it until
I am grown up,&#8221; she explained; and instead
she had a glass of milk. Breakfast over, she
gladly accepted the invitation to lie down
in the clean, white bed in the little room upstairs.
How good it was to get into a fresh
night-gown and creep between the sheets! Her
head swam from the motion of the cars, but
soon that stopped and she was in the land of
dreams.</p>

<p>She dreamed that her mother called, &#8220;Come,
Hazel, it is time for dinner,&#8221; and she answered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m coming,&#8221; and tried to run from the
bedroom into the little kitchen; but she could
not move. Again the voice called her, and
with a great effort she caught her mother&#8217;s
hand, and awoke to find that she was clutching
Mrs. Jenks&#8217; dress.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve slept a long while, dear,&#8221; her hostess
said. &#8220;There&#8217;s only time to wash and dress
for dinner. Here is hot water I&#8217;ve brought
for you. You&#8217;ll feel better when you&#8217;ve had
a bath.&#8221;</p>

<p>She washed and dressed, and was just fastening
her collar when there was a knock at her
door. Opening it she found a little girl of
about six who shyly held out to her a bunch
of roses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are these for me?&#8221; Hazel asked.</p>

<p>The child nodded.</p>

<p>Hazel looked with astonishment at the flowers.
They were like hot-house roses. At home they
would cost ten, fifteen cents apiece, so much
that you only looked at them in the florist&#8217;s
window. You could never afford to buy them,
unless it were for a wedding or a funeral. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
she held all these lovely pink and white blossoms
in her hand!</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you so much,&#8221; she said to the child,
who still remained outside. Hazel went to
the washstand and filling the glass she found
there with water, placed the roses in it. Then,
viewing her treasures with great pride, she
took out one bud and pinned it to her dress.</p>

<p>It seemed very festive, like a party, to be
wearing a pink rose. And the dinner was
festive, too, with more roses on the table and
Mr. and Mrs. Jenks and their two little daughters
talking and laughing. Hazel ate heartily of
the chicken and sweet potato and guava jelly,
the last a gift from a friend in Florida and only
put on the table at special occasions. But
this was a special occasion, for while Hazel was
only a little girl she was a visitor from the North,
and from the North&#8217;s best-loved city, Boston.</p>

<p>Dinner over, Hazel and the children played
together, building towers of blocks and destroying
them only to build others. The time
seemed short when Mrs. Jenks called her to
make ready to go to the train.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>&#8220;My husband will take you all the way,&#8221;
she said to Hazel, who rose reluctantly from the
floor. The child went to her room, took the
roses out of the water, dried their stems and
tied them together with a bit of thread from
her traveling bag. They would be a comfort,
she thought, in the dirty train. Then putting
on her hat and coat she went down stairs.</p>

<p>It was hard to say good-bye to her new
friends. The children clung to her and Mrs.
Jenks invited her to make them a visit when
she returned in the spring. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t
been a bit of trouble,&#8221; she answered in reply
to Hazel&#8217;s thanks for her hospitality. &#8220;I wish
I could keep you over night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel wished the same in her heart, but she
only said good-bye again and returned to the
railroad station.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me have your check,&#8221; Mr. Jenks
said. &#8220;And have you the money for your
ticket?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Hazel, and with a feeling
of pride, she took the money needed from her
leather purse. The business of ticket and trunk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
accomplished, the two took their seats in the
car and were soon moving out into the big
world.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t far now, is it?&#8221; asked Hazel when
they had traveled for an hour and a half.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; her companion replied, &#8220;we shall
soon be at the station; and then we drive
three miles to your grandmother&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>The station was reached at last, and when
they got out Hazel met a colored man whom
Mr. Jenks called John, and whom he seemed
to know very well. John took the check for
Hazel&#8217;s trunk, and placed the luggage on the
back of his wagon. Then giving the reins to
Mr. Jenks, he walked away.</p>

<p>&#8220;See you right soon,&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m to drive you. Jump in,&#8221; Mr. Jenks
commanded, and Hazel climbed to the seat
by his side.</p>

<p>It was sunset. There was but one house
near the station, and their road led through
a sparsely tenanted country. Slender pines
stood in the fields, and beyond the sky glowed
golden. The air was clear and fragrant, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Hazel found herself drinking in deep breaths.
Suddenly from the meadow came a bird&#8217;s
note, long and sweet and plaintive. Again
and again the bird called.</p>

<p>&#8220;A meadow lark,&#8221; Mr. Jenks said.</p>

<p>The child pressed her hands together. She
felt exquisitely sad, and yet full of awe and
wonder. The bird sang on and on from the
meadow, and when at length she left it behind,
the sunset had changed to red and the air was
growing chill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have a warm coat,&#8221; she said in answer
to Mr. Jenks&#8217; look, and she buttoned the blue
coat about her neck.</p>

<p>Fields and pines and pines and fields. The
sunset light, purple now, a single star shining
in the west. Then a cabin by the road, and
the horse stopped.</p>

<p>Hazel trembled as Mr. Jenks lifted her down.
The cabin door opened and a tall, large woman
came down the steps, put her arm about Hazel
and spoke to Mr. Jenks.</p>

<p>&#8220;You done brought my child,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Come in and rest yourself.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>&#8220;Not to-night,&#8221; Mr. Jenks answered. &#8220;I&#8217;m
going back to John&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took the trunk from the wagon and placed
it on the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, Hazel. Good-night, Aunt
Ellen,&#8221; and turning his team, he drove away.</p>

<p>The room that Hazel entered was lighted by
a kerosene lamp and a fire of logs that sent
forth a rich, yellow flame. Her grandmother
helped the child take off her hat and coat, and
then, sitting on a low chair by the blaze, drew
the little girl toward her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You favors your mother, honey,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;but your eyes looks at me like your father&#8217;s
did. They&#8217;s dark and tired, now. You&#8217;s
come over the sea and over the land clear to
your granny. Put your head on my breast
where your daddy rested when he was a
baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel put her arms around the old woman&#8217;s
neck and held her tight. Little warm pulses
of feeling swept through her. The pines, the
sunset, the bird&#8217;s note, and this loving welcome
by the open fire, all made her heart beat fast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
and her body shake. She was sobbing before
she knew it.</p>

<p>Granny understood what to do. She put
the little girl in her chair, and leaving her for
a moment came back with a gray kitten, very
small and warm and helpless. Hazel ceased
crying as she took it on her lap and gently
stroked its fur.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it named?&#8221; she asked after a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, honey; it&#8217;s been saving for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, please, I will call it Lucy after my
mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stroked it tenderly and thought of the
purring black and white kitten in the kitchen
at home.</p>

<p>&#8220;You has a sweet, loving mother, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve her picture for you.&#8221; And that settled
the question of whether Granny&#8217;s present should
be kept until Christmas.</p>

<p>It was decided not to open the trunk until
morning. A warm supper was eaten before
the fire, and then Granny declared that it was
time good little girls were in bed.</p>

<p>The room in which they sat seemed very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
large to Hazel. Granny&#8217;s big bed was at one
end, and the fire-place at the other. A door
to the left of the fire-place lead into Hazel&#8217;s
bedroom, the one other room of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here your father used to sleep, honey,&#8221;
Granny said, &#8220;and here you rest to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>But in this last statement Granny was mistaken.
After Hazel had said her prayers and
had crept among the soft feathers a terrible
feeling of loneliness came over her. She heard
her grandmother walking in the other room,
and then the light grew less and she knew the
lamp was out. Her door was open and she
could see shadows on the wall beyond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Granny,&#8221; she called. &#8220;Are you going to
bed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, honey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could I have pussy Lucy with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her grandmother brought her the little kitten
and placed it on the pillow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut your eyes, honey, and the sand man
will come.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the sand man refused to visit the little
room. Granny went to bed, and Hazel could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
hear no sound save the chirp of a late cricket
outside the open window. Out there were the
heavens, where her father had gone, filled with
their myriad stars. Was her mother gazing
at them and thinking of her? She hugged the
kitten, and looked for comfort into the other
room. It seemed to her, as she watched the
flickering shadows, that the light was growing
less. Yes, the fire would go out, and she would
be left alone in darkness. Her heart pounded
and a strange terror possessed her. She did
not yet know this new home, and while she
loved the light of the moon and the stars,
she hated blackness. If she should wake up
alone, the fire gone, only the black night about!</p>

<p>Her throat grew hot. Holding the kitten
in one hand against her warm neck and cheek,
she left her bed and walked into Granny&#8217;s
room. The firelight showed her standing there,
a slim, timid figure.</p>

<p>She sat by the hearth a minute and watched
the blaze just as her father had watched it
when he was a little boy. The kitten tumbled
to her lap, and crawled to the floor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>Then she heard a sweet, drawling voice,
&#8220;Lonely, baby? Come by the big bed to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the lonely baby climbed into the great
pile of feathers, and with one hand pillowing
her cheek, the other touching the warm face
of her father&#8217;s mother, fell fast asleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


<small>GRANNY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Hazel awoke the next morning her
grandmother was up and dressed, and moving
about the room. The child watched her unobserved.</p>

<p>Here was someone quite different from any
of the people Hazel had known. Until she
moved to Hammond Street she had met only
the small class of business and professional
colored people of her city. These men and
women dressed and acted like the cultivated
white people about them. Their view-point
was that of their New England white neighbors;
and their children, who were educated
with white children, were staunch little New
Englanders, with the same speech, the same
dress, the same ambitions as their white schoolmates.
On Hammond Street colored people
were different. But then, they were poor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
and did not have time for the niceties of life.
But no one she had known in Jamaica Plains
or in the South End was in the least like this
grandmother.</p>

<p>The first thing Hazel noted was her strength.
She had felt it the night before when she had
snuggled up against the old woman&#8217;s breast,
and she felt it this morning as she watched her
move about the room lifting the full kettle as
though it were made of tin, not of iron. And
yet the hair that the child could see under the
turban was grey, and the face bore many
wrinkles.</p>

<p>She was dressed as though she had come out
of a story book. On her head was a turban of
a rich, deep red, and about her neck was a
gay bandanna; her calico dress, faded now,
still showed its red stripes on a grey background.
Her dark brown face with its big
features was alight with expression. She was
looking toward the bed and Hazel shut her
eyes.</p>

<p>She opened them in a few seconds and
began to study the room. Here again was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
something quite outside her experience. It
was large and the walls were of wood, but
partly covered with pictures, photographs in
frames, postal cards, illustrations cut from
newspapers. On the bureau was her picture,
taken when she was a baby.</p>

<p>One end of the room was the kitchen, where
there were shelves with pots and pans and
glasses filled with delicious-looking jelly. There
was a sideboard full of china, and a table which
Granny was setting for breakfast. And last,
the room was full of a delicious fragrance, the
odor of wood smoke.</p>

<p>Granny looked over again, and nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you&#8217;s awake, sugar,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Getting
acquainted with the new room and them
as is in it. Run and dress now or the breakfast
will spoil.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel scampered into her room where everything
was in readiness for her. The little
trunk had been moved in, the pitcher was
filled with water, and the roses she had brought
were in a glass on the bureau. She dressed
carefully, putting on the blue gingham that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
showed her slender prettiness. Granny looked
approval as she came in to breakfast.</p>

<p>After breakfast the trunk was unpacked.
Granny was full of praise of the photograph
that brought her daughter home to her, and
wanted to see again and again the pretty gifts
that Hazel had received from her friends.
Then everything was put in place, the trunk
was stowed under the bed and Hazel put on
her pink sun-bonnet and went out-of-doors.</p>

<p>The morning was warm, and though it was
December she had no need of a coat. Granny&#8217;s
house was fenced in and within the enclosure
was her garden and a little outhouse in which
was a small cooking-stove and a loom. The
garden showed a few late vegetables and in
the front of the house roses climbed upon
the porch, and grew in tall bushes by the
fence.</p>

<p>The landscape dipped at the back of the
cabin, and Hazel looked over fields of corn
and stubble and dry cotton stalks. A number
of cabins were dotted about among the fields.
In front, across the road, was a hill, half covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
with pines. No house was visible from the
road, but among the pines, to the left, was a
chimney from which smoke issued. Hazel felt
that she was a long way from trolley and
library, from rattling carts and loud-voiced
children, from school and playground.</p>

<p>Dinner-time came; and after dinner there
was a long letter to write to Mother who had
learned of the journey only on hurriedly written
post-cards. But while the child kept busy,
the day was tedious to her and she was glad
with the coming of the night to seek her little
room, grown familiar now. What, she wondered,
would she do in the many days that
stretched before her? How could she ever
occupy herself until the summer came?</p>

<p>The week that followed was the longest that
Hazel had ever known. Accustomed as she
was to regular hours for school and play and
home-work she now found the time from breakfast
to supper very hard to fill. And Granny
did not help her much. She was watching
the little girl, &#8220;studying&#8221; she would have said.
So Hazel wandered about somewhat aimlessly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
and yet gradually learned to enjoy her new
surroundings.</p>

<p>Her first acquaintances were the hens.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, Granny,&#8221; she cried one morning. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
found an egg!&#8221; and she held up her treasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;You has, sugar, sure enough. I just
naturally overlooked that egg this morning.
That white hen always done find a new place
to hide from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I can find more eggs,&#8221; Hazel
thought, and hunted assiduously, but without
success. She grew fond, however, of the clucking
creatures, and often fed them from the food
left on her plate.</p>

<p>Her grandmother had a flock of turkeys,
and their wanderings lead Hazel on many a
pleasant walk. She did not like to go out
of sight of her home, but when the turkeys
turned to the pines across the road she loved
to follow them over the pine-cones among
the trees. Here she would sit and watch the
smoke as it curled from Granny&#8217;s chimney,
and would listen to the monotonous soughing
of the wind among the pines.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>But there was a serpent in this garden; it
went on four legs and grunted and was dirty
and disgusting. Hazel had seen pigs in a pig-pen
in Massachusetts, but here in Alabama
they had the freedom of the road. She soon
realized why the garden was fenced in. In
the North you imprisoned your live stock;
but in the South you let them loose and enclosed
with picket-fence your house and garden.
This was very nice for the animals but not
so nice for timid little girls. Hens, turkeys,
cows, pigs, all roamed at will. The few cows
that Hazel met were thin and spiritless, and
she did not fear them much; but when the
inquisitive pig came near to where she sat,
she jumped up and scurried away. Such great
ugly creatures, rightly called hogs! So out-of-doors,
save in the narrow garden enclosure,
had its drawbacks.</p>

<p>Granny, Hazel found, was an important
person in the neighborhood. No one went
by her porch without a word of welcome.
If she were about, Granny would call to her,
and ask her to come and meet Uncle Silas, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
Aunt Harriet, or whoever the visitor might
be. She was not especially attracted by these
people who took a long time to say that the
weather was fine, or to ask how Granny&#8217;s
hens were laying. She answered their questions,
but she did not volunteer any information.</p>

<p>One day two white ladies, for whom Granny
sometimes did laundry work, stopped as they
drove by in their buggy. They saw Hazel,
and at once began to question her. They
wanted to know why she had come to Alabama,
how she got there, and asked her many details
of her life at home. When they left Hazel
turned somewhat excitedly to her grandmother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do they say such things to me?&#8221;
she asked. &#8220;My mother, if she went to see
them, wouldn&#8217;t ask about every teenty thing
they did.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Is your pa living?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What does your ma do?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;How is she buying you such clothes?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;How long have you been to school?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Are you reckoning to stay here this winter?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Are you working for Aunt Ellen?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>&#8220;Just like that, Granny.&#8221;</p>

<p>Granny gave one of her big laughs, and sat
down with Hazel on the steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;These people here are just naturally curious,
sugar. Don&#8217;t you get put out at &#8217;em. I knows
the proper city manners. If old man Lee
above here should drink himself to death with
whiskey, or old mammy Smith down below
should burn up in her house, you city folks &#8217;ud
just inquire, polite-like, the next time you met
one of the family, &#8216;I heard you-all met with an
accident, I&#8217;m so sorry. I hope you-all is doing
well now.&#8217; But we hasn&#8217;t city manners down
here. Nothing much happens except the hoeing
of the corn and the picking of the cotton;
and when a little girl with soft eyes and a
pretty dress and sweet ways comes among us,
we&#8217;s just naturally curious. We wants to see
her and learn all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel laughed, but she still criticized the
visitors. &#8220;They weren&#8217;t pretty or well-dressed
and they made mistakes the teacher corrects us
for at school. Were they first families?&#8221;</p>

<p>Granny looked mystified.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i070.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">She still picked her cotton in the autumn and planted it in the spring</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>&#8220;Charity, you know I&#8217;ve told you about
Charity, said all the nice white people in
the South were first families. She said there
were lots of them in Virginia but she guessed
there weren&#8217;t any in Alabama.&#8221;</p>

<p>Granny answered more gravely than before,
&#8220;There&#8217;s first families everywhere, child,
but its like the Scriptures, some of them as
thinks they&#8217;re first will be last; and the last,
as thinks they&#8217;re no account, will be first.
By their fruits you shall know them; by their
charity and kindness. And it&#8217;s soon, dearie,
for you to be judging them by their fruits.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Hazel had little to busy herself with, she
saw that Granny was rarely idle. The old
woman never hurried, and was ready to stop
and speak to the passing neighbor, but when
the day was done she had accomplished a great
deal. She still picked her cotton in the autumn
and planted it in the spring; but now she was
busy about her house, her laundry, her poultry,
her spinning-wheel and loom. For she was
one of the very few old people left who spun
and wove, and travelers from many parts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
the country had bits of her handiwork. Hazel
watched her spinning with wide eyes. One
day she asked timidly if she might learn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;s right glad to teach you, honey,&#8221; was
the answer. &#8220;The children about here thinks
they&#8217;s above learning to spin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Hazel, and took her place at
the wheel.</p>

<p>And now the days grew less long and were
full of pleasant anticipation. In the morning,
before breakfast, she hunted eggs. After breakfast
was over, she put her room in order and
helped Granny with the dishes, and then she
turned to her spinning. She soon became
expert at twisting the thread, and grew so
interested that Granny sometimes had to send
her away to play. Before dinner, she went
among the pines and practised gymnastic exercises
that she had learned at school. She
was a conscientious little body; and having
come South to get well, did all that she knew
to bring about the desired result.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I am to get home,&#8221; she would argue to
herself, &#8220;I must grow stronger every day;&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
and swinging wide her arms, she would take
deep breaths of the delicious air.</p>

<p>In the afternoon she would write to her
mother, and later she and Granny would often
take a walk across the bare fields, occasionally
stopping at a neighbor&#8217;s cottage. Hazel would
look shyly at the barefooted, barelegged little
black children, but she could not think of
anything to say to them, and they in their
turn only stared.</p>

<p>When dusk came she would watch the turkeys
as they went to roost in the trees. One tree
seemed almost full of these strange birds, half
wild, half domesticated. In the evening Granny
and she would sit before the open fire and tell
one another stories. Hazel loved to recite poetry,
and Granny never tired of the &#8220;Village Blacksmith&#8221;
and &#8220;The little Shadow that goes
in and out with me.&#8221; Hazel had an odd assortment
of poems, among them Whittier&#8217;s &#8220;Slave
Ship&#8221; which she recited with great feeling.
&#8220;Those were dark days,&#8221; Granny would say,
and then perhaps, to Hazel&#8217;s unending delight,
would sing, &#8220;Let my people go,&#8221; or &#8220;Oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
freedom over me!&#8221; The strange music in the
quiet house by the open fire, stirred the child&#8217;s
heart. Then, when she was safe in bed, Granny
would stand near the candle and would make
funny figures upon the wall&mdash;Brer Rabbit and
his numerous family. And with a laugh and a
good-night, Hazel would turn over and fall
asleep.</p>

<p>So the quiet days went by and brought in
the New Year.</p>

<small>LETTERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="right">December 26.</p>

<p>Darling Mother:&mdash;</p>

<p>Christmas day is like the Fourth of July,
they set off fire crackers, and it is so warm that
you wear summer dresses. I wore my white
dress.</p>

<p>I read last night to Granny from the minister&#8217;s
book. You know he wrote, not to be opened
until Christmas. It is full of poems. The
first one says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Where did you come from, baby dear?</div>
<div class="verse">Out of the everywhere into here.</div>
</div></div>

<p>There are babies living about here, only their
mothers don&#8217;t wash them very much. There
are no bath tubs and no hot water faucets.
I take my bath in the wash tub.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span></p>


<p class="right">December 27.</p>

<p>I went to Sunday school Sunday, and there
were 16 children. The teacher comes from
the school at Jonesville, 8 miles away. It is
a fine school, as fine as the Jamaica Plains
grammar school, and ladies from the North
come down to teach. They teach only colored
boys and girls.</p>

<p>The Sunday school was in the church, and
all the boys and girls had bare feet. Some
are so poor they had no pennies to bring, and
guess, what do you think they put in the
plate, EGGS!!! Only it was a hat. An
egg is worth a penny, and I eat a great many
of them.</p>

<p>They had the same singing books we have
at Boston. Some kind ladies sent them down.
The children sing much prettier than at home.
The teeniest can sing alto.</p>

<p>Everybody is very poor. Not Granny,
her sons have been good to her. People eat
bacon. Granny often kills a chicken, but
no one, not the richest people, eat roast
beef.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span></p>


<p class="right">December 28.</p>

<p>I forgot to tell you, mother darling, that the
Sunday school teacher was colored. There were
not any classes. She explained the lesson to everybody.
I like her very much. She kissed me
good-bye and told me to come again, but Sunday
school is only once a month and so is church.</p>

<p>Tell Charity I wear the sun-bonnet some days,
and Granny says I shall wear it more when the
sun gets hot.</p>

<p>Darling Mother, I think of Father a great
deal because I sleep in his bed and Granny
showed me the first shoes he wore. They are
all out at the toes. They are not little because
he went barefoot. At first I used to cry but
now I don&#8217;t. Granny says he was always
jolly. I can make Granny laugh when I tell
her about Boston. She pretends not to believe
about elevators and sky-scrapers and telefones.
I think she really doesn&#8217;t truly believe about
telefones.</p>


<p class="right">December 30.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t mind if I sometimes skip a day, do
you, Mother? Because sometimes I am busy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
I am spinning. I am like Priscilla in Miles
Standish. It is more fun to spin than to sew
or cook or wash or iron. When Granny washes
she makes a fire out-of-doors and boils water
in a great big iron pot.</p>


<p class="right">December 31.</p>

<p>I have written a New Year&#8217;s poem for you.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Your affectionate daughter,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Hazel Tyler</span>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="right">January 1.</p>

<p>Dear Hazel,</p>

<p>A Happy New Year, darling! Last night
I saw the Old Year out and the New Year in
at the Perkins. There were thirty of us, and
we sang, and Mr. Douglass played on his violin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
until twelve o&#8217;clock. Then we all said Happy
New Year to one another.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i079.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;I am spinning. I am like Priscilla in Miles Standish&#8221;</p>

<p>The New Year has begun well for me in my
business. I have ten people I go to every
week. Just think of it! That is ten dollars
a week shampooing hair! They say I have a
gentle touch. You used to like to have me
wash your hair, do you remember? I hope
you are taking good care of it.</p>

<p>You see I am getting quite rich. I do not
do any laundry except Mrs. Hollingsworth&#8217;s.
Mrs. Hollingsworth sent the pink tea gown
the other day, and said it was not worth laundering
again, and for me to keep it. So I have it
for my little Queen of Sheba.</p>

<p>Charity helps me sometimes. I want to
tell you that I have grown very fond of Charity.
Her father is no account. He has gone away
and her mother has to work out as a cook.
That leaves Charity all alone until nine o&#8217;clock
at night, so sometimes she comes up to see me.
One afternoon, just before Christmas, I didn&#8217;t
get home until seven at night, and I found
Charity in the kitchen ironing. She had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
climbed up the fire-escape, opened the kitchen
window, and dropped in. She looked up and
said, &#8220;You bet now, I surprised you.&#8221; But
when I looked at the ironing I was more surprised.
I couldn&#8217;t have done it better.</p>

<p>Of course, I asked her to stay to supper, and
we had griddle cakes and maple syrup and we
talked about you. Then I told Charity stories.
She didn&#8217;t know Cinderella, or Jack and the
Beanstalk, and it was a real comfort to have
her put her arms around me and bid me good-night.
For it was Christmas Eve, Hazel dear.
When she left I cuddled the kitty. I gave her
a collar with a bell on it for Christmas.</p>

<p>We are having snow and cold east winds,
while you are playing in the sunshine without
a coat. Mr. Perkins pretends to be very
provoked every time I see him, and says
Boston has the finest climate in the world,
but I am glad you are escaping it. It has
snowed and thawed and rained and snowed
again all in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The ladies in the church sewing-circle sent a
box last week to a school for colored children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
at Jonesville. They tell me that it is quite
near you. I wonder if you have heard of it.</p>

<p>I hope you are getting stronger every day,
darling, and that when you come home Charity
will have to lend you her clothes, you will be
so plump.</p>

<p>Give Granny my love, and kiss pussy Lucy
for me to-night. I have named my kitten
for you.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Your loving,</span><br />

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>THAT OLD TIME RELIGION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Lee family had left their cabin up the
road and were on their way to church. They
were all out this Sunday evening, old man Lee,
sober for once, his wife, Scipio, a heavy, solemn-looking
boy of thirteen, Julius, Theora, Thomas
and Ezekiel. Mother Lee had evidently long
since given up keeping all her children&#8217;s clothes
in repair. Her boys&#8217; garments were few
and ragged. But upon her little girl she
had attempted some embellishment. Theora&#8217;s
crinkly hair was tied with a piece of bright
cotton cloth, and on her feet were shoes and
stockings.</p>

<p>The family caught up with Granny and Hazel,
and the mother felt a sullen resentment at
Hazel&#8217;s dress. The child wore her blue coat,
and a dark blue hat with a grey quill. She
nodded pleasantly to her neighbors, but kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
close to Granny&#8217;s side. She was afraid of
old man Lee whom she had seen one night
staggering past her home, and his children
seemed dull. Granny, who had a kindly word
for everyone, talked with the mother, and
Hazel watched the deepening twilight.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant walk to church, along the
road and then through the open fields. At
a turn to the west the new moon shone before
them, a clear bow in the deep blue sky. Hazel
stopped to look at the lovely crescent; but
she was recalled to earth by hearing a sharp
voice call: &#8220;Where you going, Scip? Stop
your mooning and help me with Zeke.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scipio had been looking at the moon, too!
She watched him with awakening sympathy
as, moving past her, he picked up his little
brother. As she hurried to join Granny she
found herself by his side, and turning, and
nodding her head toward the moon, she said
in her clear, distinct voice: &#8220;It is pretty, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Scipio.</p>

<p>The church was small, and when they entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
the bare room was more than half filled, so
they took their places near the door. The
only light was furnished by two kerosene
lamps, and in the corners of the room were
strange shadows. As the black men and women
and children continued to come the place
grew crowded and the air became close and
full of an uncleanly odor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Move up, Hazel,&#8221; Granny said, for the
child was at the end of the bench and there
was space for one more on it.</p>

<p>Hazel moved up reluctantly, dreading a
seat-mate, but Scipio, who had been standing,
slipped in at her side. She felt relieved.</p>

<p>The minister, a portly man in a long black
coat, mounted the platform and the congregation
began to sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;That old time religion,</div>
<div class="verse">That old time religion,</div>
<div class="verse">That old time religion,</div>
<div class="verse">Is good enough for me.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>They did not rise, but remained in their
seats swaying a little back and forth. It was
strange minor music.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>After the singing, the minister prayed and
read from the Bible, and then he began to
preach. He gave as his text:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how
can ye escape the damnation of Hell?&#8221;</p>

<p>He began by drawing a picture of heaven,
the dwelling-place of the saints. He measured
the thousand furlongs of the city; he depicted
the streets of gold and the gates of pearl; he
garnished the walls with chrysolite, beryl and
amethyst. His voice at times was low and
soft, and then suddenly it became loud and
dramatic, and almost shook the little building.
Hazel awoke from her absorption in his manner
to note his words when he called out:</p>

<p>&#8220;And the building of the wall was jasper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; she thought triumphantly, &#8220;I was
right that day and Charity was wrong. Jasper
isn&#8217;t something to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was wholly unaccustomed to hearing
the congregation take a spontaneous part in
the service, and was amazed at their frequent
cries of &#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; and &#8220;Amen.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the preacher did not mean to dwell long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
this evening on the celestial sphere. He was
concerned with showing his hearers the terrors
of the underworld. In a few moments he
depicted them as standing in the lake of fire
and brimstone, burning, burning, not for a day
but forever and ever. The flames seemed to
leap up as the minister shouted: &#8220;And the
devil will reach out for you, ye generation of
vipers, he&#8217;ll reach out for you across the flames,
and he&#8217;ll catch you and draw you into the
burning lake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord save us!&#8221; &#8220;Please have mercy, Jesus,&#8221;
came from the moaning crowd.</p>

<p>Hazel was aghast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to the Lord and be saved,&#8221; cried
the preacher. &#8220;Be saved by the blood of the
Lamb!&#8221;</p>

<p>A change came over the congregation. The
moaning ceased. From different parts of the
room arose calls of &#8220;Yes, Jesus,&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;s coming,
Lord.&#8221; Women began to sway back and forth,
crying loudly for salvation.</p>

<p>Hazel looked at Granny. The old woman
had forgotten her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>&#8220;The devil shan&#8217;t get us in the burning
pit,&#8221; shouted the preacher.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Lord,&#8221; said Granny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord save us,&#8221; shouted old man Lee in
front.</p>

<p>Hazel grew frightened. She felt suffocated
and wanted to get away. Glancing at Scipio
she saw that he sat as stolid as ever, unmoved
apparently by all that was going on about
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scip,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;I want to get
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her frightened face, and, taking
her hand, butted with his head until he had
made a way through the crowd of people
standing between them and the open door.
Then they passed out into the night.</p>

<p>The little moon was setting behind the trees.
The air was fresh and cool, but not chill. Above
were the peaceful stars.</p>

<p>&#8220;The heathen are burning,&#8221; shouted the
preacher, &#8220;and every day the devil pours on
fresh oil and the flames mount higher and
higher to the sky.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>&#8220;Scip,&#8221; said Hazel with a quick breath,
&#8220;do you believe in hell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Scipio.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t believe what he is saying? You
don&#8217;t believe God will put us in fire to burn
forever and ever?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I seen a lynching once,&#8221; Scipio replied.
&#8220;It were just like that, they poured on oil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t,&#8221; Hazel gasped. She seized his
arm with her two hands; &#8220;don&#8217;t,&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>After a moment she whispered, &#8220;But it
didn&#8217;t last forever. He died?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am. He died.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And wicked men burned him, and it was
only for a few minutes. God wouldn&#8217;t make
him burn forever and ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you fret,&#8221; said Scipio. She had
let go of his arm, but he knew that she was
trembling. &#8220;They-all is sure they&#8217;ll get off.
They&#8217;s sure the devil won&#8217;t catch them. There&#8217;s
my pa, he ain&#8217;t done a stroke of work this week.
Been crazy drunk. But he&#8217;s got religion. Hear
him holler!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s like that, Scip,&#8221; Hazel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
said very earnestly. &#8220;Religion is being good
and honest and pure in heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>A man approached the children as they
stood a little apart from the throng about the
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Howdy, little &#8217;un,&#8221; he leered, lounging up to
Hazel. &#8220;You&#8217;s a pretty trick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel caught Scipio by the hand.</p>

<p>The boy moved forward into the light,
leaving the little girl in the shadow. He held
her hand tight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her alone,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Deliver us from the fire of hell and take
us into the kingdom of heaven,&#8221; called the
preacher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Amen, Hallelujah,&#8221; came out upon the night.</p>

<p>The strange man advanced another step
toward Hazel. Scipio stood still, his chin
forward like a bulldog. The man muttered a
curse and turned away.</p>

<p>A hymn was sung and the service broke
up. Granny was among the first to leave the
building.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;s glad to find you, child,&#8221; she said as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Hazel came up to her. &#8220;Where you done
gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I felt faint, Granny, and came out to get
a breath of fresh air,&#8221; Hazel explained.</p>

<p>At that moment old man Lee called roughly
to his son, &#8220;Come here, you lazy hound,&#8221;
and moved as if to strike him.</p>

<p>Hazel started forward. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t blame
Scip, Mr. Lee,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He&#8217;s been taking
care of me.&#8221; And turning to the boy she
added: &#8220;Thank you, Scip.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something in her speech, perhaps the unfamiliar
&#8220;Mr. Lee,&#8221; quieted the old man.
He turned away from his eldest son who went
to help with the baby.</p>

<p>Hazel was silent on the way home, for she
felt that this time Granny could not share her
thoughts. The old woman was happy at having
seen her friends and hummed a hymn.
Perhaps, had Hazel given her her confidence,
she would have said that hell was just a place
to scare people with: that the Lord never
meant the devil should keep anyone there.</p>

<p>They reached home before the Lees whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
they saw coming slowly behind, Scipio with
the baby in his arms.</p>

<p>Granny gave Hazel a good-night kiss, but
the little girl did not go at once to bed. For
some time, wrapped in her warm shawl, she
sat at the window, looking out upon the stars.
They rested her perturbed spirit. At length,
a smile lighted her face. A new thought had
come to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;My own father wouldn&#8217;t have hurt anybody,&#8221;
she whispered. &#8220;Not even if they
were wicked. And God is my Father in
Heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>And comforted, she knelt and said the Lord&#8217;s
prayer, and asked God to bless her mother
and Charity and Mr. and Mrs. Perkins and
Granny and&mdash;and Scip.</p>

<small>BROTHER AND SISTER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Do</span> you know, Scip,&#8221; Hazel confided, &#8220;I&#8217;m
dreadfully afraid of pigs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t hurt you,&#8221; Scip replied.</p>

<p>The two children were sitting among the
pines on the hill that overlooked their homes.
A few hogs grunted near them among the cones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I&#8217;m not afraid when you&#8217;re here,&#8221;
Hazel explained, &#8220;but when I come up alone
sometimes they try to get around me and it
makes me fidgety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They might give you fleas,&#8221; said Scip.</p>

<p>He found a stick for her. &#8220;Hit &#8217;em with
that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;ll fix &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would it do for cows, too, Scip?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid of cows and pigs and I&#8217;m
terribly afraid of bulls. I expect you think
I&#8217;m a coward.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Scip said, looking squarely
at her. &#8220;You wasn&#8217;t afraid of my father,
Sunday night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel changed the subject. &#8220;What do you
want to do when you grow up?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to school.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl laughed. &#8220;Why now&#8217;s the time to
go to school, before you grow up. You can&#8217;t
go afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I?&#8221; the boy asked anxiously, &#8220;I
ain&#8217;t got time now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you been to school at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Six weeks when I were ten, and four weeks
when I were eight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you can&#8217;t read?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;s feared I&#8217;s forgot. I can print some.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel thought a moment, and then said,
&#8220;Would you like me to teach you, Scip? I&#8217;m
not busy. I don&#8217;t have anything that I <i>have</i>
to do except make my bed, and of course I
help Granny with the dishes and ironing. I
can iron nicely now, and I can spin, too. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
I could teach you any time you would come.
I have books.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scipio dug a stick in the ground and scattered
the pine-cones. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t smart,&#8221; he
muttered. &#8220;I&#8217;s feared you couldn&#8217;t learn me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; Hazel answered. &#8220;I&#8217;m a young
teacher, don&#8217;t you think, Scip?&#8221; She jumped
up and laughed. &#8220;You must do everything
I say. Let&#8217;s begin now. I&#8217;ll go and get my
books.&#8221;</p>

<p>She ran down the hill, her blue dress blowing
in the wind, her small head gaily erect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like a blue-bird,&#8221; Scipio thought.</p>

<p>She came back in a few minutes, her hands
full.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve pencil and paper,&#8221; she called. &#8220;Scip,
can&#8217;t we find a nice place to keep school in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a green spot a way up,&#8221; the boy
replied. &#8220;You might like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He led her among the trees to a little enclosure.
Small pines, not more than six feet
high, made a natural hedge, and shut them
out from the road below.</p>

<p>&#8220;How pretty,&#8221; cried Hazel. &#8220;It&#8217;s like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
little house. Here, take the books, Scip, and
I&#8217;ll decide what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>He obediently held the books for her.</p>

<p>As she looked about among the pines a new
idea came to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t call it school,&#8221; she declared.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll play house. You and I will be brother
and sister. We&#8217;ll play that I&#8217;ve had advantages,
I&#8217;ve been North to school, and now I&#8217;ve come
home. This will be our house and this,&#8221; tapping
with her foot, &#8220;will be the parlor. We&#8217;ll
sit down here and I&#8217;ll teach you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took the books and papers from his hands
and placed them on the ground. &#8220;I can sit
down and lean against this tree and pretend
I&#8217;m in a chair. Here is the paper and pencil.
I haven&#8217;t a primer so I&#8217;ll start and print the
letters. Sit down, Scip.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seated himself beside her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know your alphabet?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t rightly know whether I remember
it all, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t say ma&#8217;am to me, I&#8217;m your
sister.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel laughed. &#8220;You&#8217;re so funny, Scip.
Now do you know what that letter is?&#8221; pointing
to the first on his paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Sister. That&#8217;s A.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little girl almost jumped at her new name.
She did not know how common the appellation
was in the South.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the next one, Scip?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;B.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so on. I and J proved stumbling blocks,
but once passed the end was reached without
further mistake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now words,&#8221; said Hazel, turning from the
alphabet, &#8220;are letters put together. Can you
spell any words?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can print my name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please do, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scipio took the pencil and laboriously printed
<span class="gesperrt">SCIPIO LEE</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;The C isn&#8217;t pronounced,&#8221; Hazel said
thoughtfully. &#8220;I guessed it was spelt SIPIO.
You can never guess at spelling, though, it&#8217;s
so queer.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i099.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Scipio Lee</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fool name,&#8221; said Scip, moodily.
&#8220;My pa and ma done give us all fool names
but Tom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think Scipio was a Roman, and the Romans
were very brave. You aren&#8217;t afraid of anything
are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;s afraid of my father.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel was silent. She felt very sorry for
her new playmate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we go on?&#8221; she said at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

<p>She let the &#8220;ma&#8217;am&#8221; pass, and began to
teach again.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll spell the things about us. There
are the pigs. See, pig is spelt <span class="gesperrt">PIG</span>.&#8221; And
she printed it for him.</p>

<p>He slowly repeated the letters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say it phonetically,&#8221; she commanded.
&#8220;P&mdash;ig.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tried unsuccessfully to imitate her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Scip, you&#8217;re so funny. This is the
sound of P, Pe&#804;, Pe&#804;.&#8221; She blew the P out
from between her lips. &#8220;P&mdash;ig P&mdash;en, P&mdash;encil,
P, P, P, say them, Scip.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>He did better this time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, can&#8217;t you think of something that
begins with P yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;P, P, P, Peep,&#8221; Scip said, stumbling on the
word by chance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s what the chickens
say, isn&#8217;t it? Have you chickens at your
house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Sister. We tries to raise &#8217;em; but
they ain&#8217;t pert like Aunt Ellen&#8217;s chickens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another P. P&mdash;ert. Don&#8217;t you
hear it, Scip?&#8221;</p>

<p>He repeated it after her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! Now I&#8217;ll write these words for
your lesson to-morrow. Can you come here
to-morrow, do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I try to,&#8221; he answered, looking at her
gravely. &#8220;We ain&#8217;t over busy now. Ma, she&#8217;d
be glad to have me come. She&#8217;d kep&#8217; me in
school if she&#8217;d been &#8217;lowed. I come if I can,
but I can&#8217;t never be sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the best time for you to get away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon when dinner&#8217;s done. Pa goes to
sleep then sometimes.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>&#8220;We&#8217;ll play like this, Scip. I&#8217;ll always be
here after dinner, if it is pleasant. Granny
doesn&#8217;t need me then, so I&#8217;ll come to my house
up here. And I&#8217;ll brush up, and get things
tidy; and if my brother comes I&#8217;ll teach him
his lessons. If he doesn&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll play by myself.
Now I&#8217;ll write out your words.&#8221; And she made
a fair copy and handed it to him.</p>

<p>He held it by the corner carefully, afraid of
soiling the page.</p>

<p>Hazel gathered up her belongings and together
they moved from the little enclosure.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is our house, isn&#8217;t it, Scip? And we
won&#8217;t tell anyone about it. We might go to
it a roundabout way. Oh, where is my stick
to scare the pigs with?&#8221;</p>

<p>Scipio brought it to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;This ain&#8217;t much account,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
done bring you a better one to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you? Thank you. Good-bye, Scip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>He watched her run down the road and into
her grandmother&#8217;s open door. Then he trudged
home.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>Hazel told Granny that evening of what
she had undertaken.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;s right glad, sugar,&#8221; Granny said heartily.
&#8220;That boy&#8217;s been put upon. The old man
works him like he was a mule, and then drinks
up all he makes. They is Ward&#8217;s tenants,
he that keeps the store down the tracks, and
Ward always gives his tenants whiskey. I
pity that poor woman. Every year it&#8217;s just
the same. Slave, slave and not a thing to
show for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scip says they had a good crop of cotton
last year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s right, they done did. And what good
come to them? Ward, he weighed the cotton
and &#8217;lowed old man Lee owed it on his books.
He see to it his men always owes the half of
the cotton and the half of the corn as is theirs
by rights.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel looked puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand, child, and it ain&#8217;t
no wonder. But I&#8217;s been through it. I&#8217;s
owned my land many years now, though,
thanks to my sons. You see, Ward, the master<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
here, he owns the land and the store and the
seed and the mules and the cows and the
calves. Along come a colored family, like the
Lees, and the master say to them: &#8216;You-all
wants work. I done give you-all a house and
mule for half the crop you done raise.&#8217; Understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I understand,&#8221; said Hazel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the family move in; but they&#8217;s got
to plant and make the crops afore anything
comes to them. Then Master Ward he tell
them to trade at his store and there ain&#8217;t no
hurry to pay. So he run up a bill against
them, charging what he feel like, and he sell
the old man whiskey, &#8217;stead of shoes for the
children, &#8217;cause there&#8217;s more money made in
whiskey than in shoes and when fall come the
crop is all drunk up, all traded off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Granny, my mother keeps such careful
accounts, every penny. Don&#8217;t they know how
much money they spend?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course they don&#8217;t. They don&#8217;t have
pennies to spend, honey. And the store won&#8217;t
give them no account.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>&#8220;Then no matter how hard Scip works he
won&#8217;t get any money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a cent, sugar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then if I were he I wouldn&#8217;t work at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckon you&#8217;d be turned out then pretty
quick without a roof over your head. That
happened once before Scip were big. The
others they ain&#8217;t much account for work.
They was born tired. But Scip he&#8217;s strong and
steady-like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he&#8217;ll run away and get rich.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he will,&#8221; said Granny, &#8220;and perhaps
he&#8217;ll stay by his mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>The teaching progressed, for Hazel was unusually
apt for a child at her profession; and
if Scip failed at times as a pupil it was not for
lack of application on his part. At least four
afternoons in the week he found it possible
to slip away from the fields or the dirty cabin
to the house, as Hazel liked to call it, among
the pines. She had made it look like a dwelling-place,
bringing two boxes for seats and a third
for a table. One day Scipio brought her some
early violets and she flew down to Granny&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
for a tin can which she filled with water. In
this she placed the flowers, setting the can in a
corner against the pines. After that the tin
vase was often filled. When her pupil could
not come she tidied her pine-needle carpet,
or, armed with the two-pronged stick Scip
had given her, walked bravely among the cows
and the grunting pigs. Some days teacher
and scholar found it too cold to sit still long
and raced one another through the trees, or
teased the turkeys whose &#8220;gobble, gobble&#8221;
always amused Hazel. But usually they worked
hard at the task of learning to read. Hazel
wisely gave up for the present the effort to teach
the boy&#8217;s clumsy fingers to guide the pencil
to write.</p>

<p>One afternoon he was late and seemed unusually
slow in responding to his teacher&#8217;s
questionings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Scip, you must remember that word,&#8221;
Hazel said impatiently. &#8220;Look down and study
the letters again,&#8221; and she pointed to the
<span class="gesperrt">HORSE</span> plainly printed on the copy in her
lap.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>As the boy bent over she saw that his hair
was matted with blood, and that blood was
oozing from a gash in his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scip,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;what has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you mind Sister,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I
can read the letters,&#8221; he went on&mdash;&#8220;<span class="gesperrt">HORSE</span>&#8221;&mdash;studying
it, &#8220;but I can&#8217;t rightly remember
what they done spell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scip, how did your head get that way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going right to the house to get some
water to wash the blood off for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you do that, Hazel,&#8221; he said earnestly.
&#8220;It ain&#8217;t much, and you&#8217;d mind the blood.
My father&#8217;s been drunk again,&#8221; he added
sullenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Scip, dear, I&#8217;m so sorry,&#8221; Hazel cried,
&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry,&#8221; and longing to give such comfort
as she could she put her arms about his
neck and kissed him.</p>

<p>The tears came to the boy&#8217;s eyes. His
child&#8217;s face, grown dull and expressionless from
neglect and cruelty, quivered in every muscle.
Hazel moved back shyly, startled at her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
own impulsiveness. He looked down at the
copy in her lap, at her slender brown hands,
and said gently, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you mind, Hazel. I
don&#8217;t mind no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then placing his black finger on the word
over which he had been puzzling, &#8220;It&#8217;s &#8216;Horse,&#8217;
ain&#8217;t it? <span class="gesperrt">Horse</span>, Horse. Reckon you thought
I was a mule!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>LOST</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Granny</span>, it was as cold as Boston in my
room this morning. It doesn&#8217;t seem as though
it would ever be warm again. It&#8217;s freezing
cold!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s freezing, indeed, honey, but eat breakfast
and you&#8217;ll be warmer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first winter weather had come when,
by the calendar, winter should have been nearly
over. Hazel had so long enjoyed the mild
air that she had begun to believe nothing else
was possible in Alabama. Now she was to
learn that in a warm climate one most keenly
feels the cold.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if Mother is freezing up in Boston,&#8221;
she mused, as she and Granny together did
the housework. &#8220;She goes out to work a
good deal now. I hope she isn&#8217;t taking cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t borrow trouble, honey.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>&#8220;But if she should take cold Charity would
take care of her. Charity gets her supper
sometimes now, Mother says, when she&#8217;s tired.
And then Mother reads to her out of the Blue
Fairy Book. I couldn&#8217;t bring many books,
Granny, in just one little trunk, but I do wish
I could read to you in the Blue Fairy Book.
You would like it so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I done rob Charity of her good time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But in Boston,&#8221; Hazel explained, &#8220;you
have a library where you can get any book
in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Telephone for it, I suppose,&#8221; said Granny
sceptically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Hazel absently.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be too cold for Scip to come to play
house this afternoon,&#8221; the little girl declared
somewhat petulantly as they sat at dinner
after a morning indoors; &#8220;his father&#8217;s sure to
be cross. But I&#8217;ll go up, Granny, because I
never miss, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>She put on her hat and her warm coat and
climbed the little hill.</p>

<p>The wind was high, but crouched in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
enclosure, Hazel scarcely felt it. But she
could hear it though, soughing through the
pines&mdash;she believed the trees were never silent.
To-day their singing leaves trumpeted the winter
and called for action.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I&#8217;ll go to the top of the hill,&#8221; she
said to herself. &#8220;Scip isn&#8217;t coming and it&#8217;s
a good day to explore.&#8221;</p>

<p>She climbed up the hillside, striking once
with her trusty stick at a stray pig, and soon
reached the top. Below on one side was her
home and the cabins with which she was familiar;
on the other side stretched an unknown
country, a land where she had been told the
white folks lived.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go just a little further,&#8221; Hazel decided.</p>

<p>The cold air made her feel like exercising.
She was in much better health than when she
had come to Alabama; in better health, her
mother would have seen, than she had ever
been in her life. The tingling air gave her
courage, and she raced unconcernedly past
cows and pigs down the hill on the other side.</p>

<p>It seemed remarkably like the side she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
left. There were the same log cabins, the same
stretches of land filled with dry cotton stalks,
the same hens, the same hogs. If she came
upon a clapboarded house it was devoid of
paint. She met an occasional lean, ragged
white child, dull of complexion, who stared
at her but had no word of greeting. But the
cold kept the people indoors.</p>

<p>Hazel walked a little way along the road,
when she was startled by a dog, which ran out
from under a house and barked furiously
at her. She held her stick tight, determined
to use it if necessary, though Scip had said
nothing about hitting dogs. But the animal
only barked and she passed by it in safety.
This incident, however, made her apprehensive,
and after a little more investigation
without interesting results she turned to go
home.</p>

<p>What had become of the hill down which
she had run?</p>

<p>It seemed to have melted into the landscape.
Striving to retrace her steps she ran up one
acclivity after another, wearying herself in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
hunt, but from none did she see the Lees&#8217;
cabin and Granny&#8217;s home. And the more
she ran, the more she became completely
turned around.</p>

<p>The sun was low in the west. It was bitter
cold and she felt tired. Worst of all, she was
in the land of the unknown white folk who
called you &#8220;nigger,&#8221; and who went their way
and wanted you to go yours. How could she
ask her way of them?</p>

<p>She walked briskly along the road again,
searching for a house where a colored family
lived. Indeed, there were such houses, but
their occupants were snuggled over their fires,
and did not come out and show their friendly
dark faces to the little colored girl. Only a
dog rushed at her. She thought at first it
was the one that had barked when she
came over the hill, but this was an ugly cur
that snapped at her heels, and caused her to
run, it mattered not in what direction, so that
she left it behind.</p>

<p>When she took note again of her surroundings
the sun was dropping into a dark cloud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
near the horizon. She was familiar now with
the short twilight of the South, and she knew
that night would soon be upon her. She must
be brave and knock at one of these houses to
ask the way.</p>

<p>Her training led her to choose the most
pretentious one in sight, a large, square, unpainted,
frame house. And again her training
sent her to the front door where she knocked
timidly.</p>

<p>The door was opened almost immediately, as
though someone had been passing through the
hall, and a high-pitched voice bade her enter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose child are you?&#8221; the voice said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Aunt Ellen&#8217;s granddaughter,&#8221; answered
Hazel, knowing enough to call her
grandmother by that familiar title, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve
lost my way. Can you please tell me how to
get back to her house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sister,&#8221; the white woman called shrilly,
and another woman appeared at an open door
at Hazel&#8217;s left, &#8220;here&#8217;s Aunt Ellen&#8217;s child come
to ask her way, and if the little nigger didn&#8217;t
knock at the front door!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say so, Jane,&#8221; said Sister.</p>

<p>Hazel recognized the two white ladies who
had stopped at Granny&#8217;s house on their drive,
and had asked her so many questions. She
pressed her lips tightly together at the word
&#8220;nigger,&#8221; but then she had expected it, and
anyway they knew where Granny lived. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t want to be any trouble,&#8221; she said in her
most dignified manner, &#8220;and if you will please
explain to me how to get to Granny&#8217;s, I will
go. I came over the hill, but it is getting so
dark I am afraid I couldn&#8217;t return that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>If she imagined she would be permitted to
leave so easily she was mistaken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come by the kitchen,&#8221; Miss Jane said,
and led her to the rear of the house.</p>

<p>Hazel went unwillingly, but the bright fire
in the stove made her give a little cry of
pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Warm yourself, child,&#8221; Miss Jane said
kindly. &#8220;Rest your hat and coat, and sit
by the fire. How much might that coat
cost now?&#8221; she asked, examining the garment
that Hazel obediently took off.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Hazel replied. &#8220;It was
given to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who might give you a coat like that?&#8221;
the other sister queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;A friend of my father&#8217;s. You know my
father is dead,&#8221; Hazel added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know, honey,&#8221; Miss Jane said
sympathetically. &#8220;He was a right nice boy.
He used to come here to sell my mother vegetables.
He&#8217;d fix everything to sell as neat
and nice, and he&#8217;d tell about the doings around
his way until we&#8217;d almost die laughing. I&#8217;ve
often wondered if he took to gardening up
North.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We had a tiny garden where we lived,&#8221;
Hazel answered eagerly, &#8220;and father worked
in it in the early morning before he went to
business. He was a lawyer, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A lawyer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am, a lawyer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A nigger lawyer! That beats all. Marty,&#8221;
calling into the darkness, &#8220;did you know
Aunt Ellen&#8217;s son, George, used to be a nigger
lawyer?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>&#8220;Yes, Miss Jane; I sure knowed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is his child. Make her a cup of warm
coffee and give her some biscuits. She&#8217;s come
a long way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The coffee, an unfamiliar but delectable
drink, warmed not only Hazel&#8217;s body, but her
heart. The two sisters did not leave the kitchen,
but plied her with questions which she answered,
trying to remember what Granny had told
her. Here were two women living alone in
a big house with few neighbors; they were
giving her food and she ought to talk if they
wanted her to. So she told them about her
former home, and the flat in Hammond Street,
and her mother&#8217;s present work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to me your father ought to have
left something if he had a practice,&#8221; the younger
sister, whose name was Laura, remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He did,&#8221; Hazel answered quickly; &#8220;but
mother won&#8217;t touch anything but the interest,
and you know what seems a good deal of money
makes a very little interest. She spent some
to send me down here, and she&#8217;s planning to
spend more to send me to college.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>&#8220;What will you do with all your learning?&#8221;
Miss Jane asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll teach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Niggers?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel did not want to answer; but sitting
very erect, with a precision that would have
done any teacher credit, she replied: &#8220;Everybody
goes to school in Boston, every single
child. And the teachers don&#8217;t ask whether
they are black or white, or rich or poor. There
are Turks, and Arabians, and (switching to
the map of Europe as safer ground) Hungarians,
and Bulgarians, and Norwegians, and
Swedians, (doubtfully) and Greeks, and Spaniards,
and Romans, and Germans and Irish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say,&#8221; exclaimed Miss Laura,
&#8220;all those heathen!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;When are you going home?&#8221; asked Miss
Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;In May, I think, if anyone can be found
to take me. I came down with Mrs. Graham,
but she doesn&#8217;t return until July.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A white lady?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>&#8220;No, Miss Fairmount.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel had heard the name in the course of
their conversation, and felt pleased to be able
to use it.</p>

<p>But Miss Fairmount felt differently.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Jane,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You should
call me Miss Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Miss Fairmount?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not. It is impertinent in a nigger.&#8221;</p>

<p>The blood rushed to Hazel&#8217;s face. She felt
as though someone had struck her. Rising
from her chair she said in an unsteady voice,
&#8220;I must go home now. Granny will be anxious.
Please tell me what road to take?&#8221;</p>

<p>Night had come on and the lamps were
lighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose we&#8217;d let you go home
alone, child,&#8221; Miss Jane said. &#8220;Marty &#8217;ll take
you. Marty, you get on your shawl and take
Hazel to Aunt Ellen&#8217;s. It&#8217;s not far beyond
your house. Laura, show Hazel the birds in
the parlor. Maybe she&#8217;d like to look at
them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>Miss Laura took up a lamp, and led the child
into the parlor, where she had been sitting
when Hazel entered the house. The walls
were bare of pictures and the furniture was
heavy and decayed. In one corner was a
table on which was a glass case containing
three stuffed birds, a mocker, a humming bird
and a cardinal. Hazel admired appreciatively,
but her eyes would wander across the room
where stood a huge four-poster, covered with
an elaborate spread.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re very pretty,&#8221; she said politely.
&#8220;Granny tells me I must hear the mocking
birds in the spring. We don&#8217;t have mocking
birds in Massachusetts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The North and the South are very different,&#8221;
Miss Laura said, looking perplexedly
at the child.</p>

<p>Hazel called them Miss Jane and Miss Laura
when she said good-bye. She held out her
hand a little shyly to Miss Jane, fearing that
might be impertinent in the South. But Miss
Jane took it, and stroked her coat, and told
her to come again, and Miss Laura shook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
hands too, and sent a message to Aunt Ellen.
Then, the good-bye over, in proper southern
fashion the little colored girl went out the back
door.</p>

<p>Marty was not communicative, like her mistress,
and scarcely spoke as they walked along
the dark road. When they had gone a short
distance past her cabin a boy appeared ahead
of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hazel,&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scip,&#8221; she answered, and ran to him.</p>

<p>He caught her roughly. &#8220;Where you been?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was lost, Scip, and I asked Miss Jane and
Miss Laura the way home, and I had to wait
until Marty could come home with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckon I can leave you now,&#8221; Marty said,
and with an interchange of good-nights she
turned back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was Granny worried, Scip?&#8221; Hazel asked.
&#8220;Did she send you for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In course she were worried. You hadn&#8217;t
ought to be out at night alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel explained what had happened. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
hurried over the road, and once she stumbled
and caught Scip&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;How cold you are!&#8221; she exclaimed; and
noticed that he had only a ragged jacket and
that his feet were bare.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was kind of you to come, Scip,&#8221; she
began, and then she saw Granny on the road
in front of her cabin, and ran into her arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come in and get warm?&#8221; she
called to the boy; but he answered &#8220;No,&#8221;
and went on his way.</p>

<p>Granny heard the whole story that night
before the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tried to remember what you said about
knowing them by their fruits,&#8221; Hazel explained
seriously, &#8220;and they were kind to me and
gave me food and sent me home with Marty.
But they hurt my feelings dreadfully. They
said I was impertinent when I said &#8216;Miss
Fairmount,&#8217; instead of &#8216;Miss Jane,&#8217; and at
home, really truly, it would have been impertinent
to have said Miss Jane; and,&#8221; the
child hung her head, &#8220;they called me &#8216;nigger.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Granny&#8217;s strong, kindly face grew sad.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;s a hard road to travel, dearie, as you
goes through life with your pretty face and your
gentle ways. I&#8217;s feared the stones will often
bruise your feet and the briars tear your hands.
Shall I give you a token to keep in your heart
as you go down the road? I learned it to
your father when he was a boy and he never
forgot it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please tell me, Granny, and I will not
forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch <i>how</i> folks says things, and not <i>what</i>
they says. Now, Miss Jane, she didn&#8217;t do that
to-day, and she hurt my baby girl. She ain&#8217;t
quality and that&#8217;s a fact. She were thinking
of the words when you said &#8216;Miss Jane&#8217;
and not the feeling in your heart and voice.
Don&#8217;t you make the mistake she made.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel was silent for a few seconds. When
she answered her voice was unsteady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody knows how angry I am, right
through, when anyone calls me a nigger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet, honey, I&#8217;s heard a forlorn, ignorant
mammy say it to her baby when it sounded
like she were whispering to the Lord. It&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
an ugly word. I hates it, too. But there&#8217;s
white folks as don&#8217;t mean any harm by it.
You fell in good hands to-day, and I thank
the Lord for it. There&#8217;s those as might have
spoken slick enough but as would have been
rough in their hearts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel gave Granny a hug.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do love you, Granny,&#8221; she said with a
little sob, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll forget all the horrid things
to-day, and remember the coffee and the fire
and Miss Laura showing me those three poor
little stuffed birds. But Granny;&#8221; brightening,
&#8220;what do you think was in their parlor?
Why, right there in the company room in that
great big house they had a bed!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>SPRING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hazel</span> awoke one morning to find it spring.
She had seen it beginning, but she had not
fully recognized it until now. A mocking
bird told her all about it. He sat on a rosebush
and chattered so fast and so gaily and as
it seemed to Hazel of such a number of happenings,
that she hurried through breakfast
to learn what it was all about. And then she
saw that spring had come.</p>

<p>&#8220;Granny, look!&#8221; she cried excitedly. &#8220;Everything
is growing. The leaves are jumping
out, just as fast, and the flowers are opening
and the birds are singing, singing! Why that
mocking bird&#8221;&mdash;she stopped for the highest
praise she could command, &#8220;Why that mocking
bird is lots jollier than any birds we have
near Boston.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sugar,&#8221; said Granny, &#8220;I&#8217;s glad to
know once when the South come out on top.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>&#8220;Why, Granny,&#8221; Hazel went on, disregarding
the gentle sarcasm, &#8220;our teacher used to
take us out in the spring to hear the bluebirds
and song sparrows, and they just twitter,
twitter like little birds, but that mocking
bird!&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped to listen again to the riot of song
that came from the slender bird standing
with tilted tail on the top of the rosebush.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s talking to his mate, sugar,&#8221; said
Granny. &#8220;Run out and play all the morning.
The spring done call you, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel accepted spring&#8217;s summons, and ran
down the road. She had not gone far when
a redbird whistled, and she stopped to hear
his full rich notes. A Judas tree blossomed
across the road. Sweet-smelling blossoms and
bright new leaves seemed everywhere. Even
the pine showed fresh young shoots at the
end of each bough. Truly the world was
made new.</p>

<p>She had wandered for two hours up and down
the road and among the pines until she found
herself on the hill just above the Lees&#8217; cabin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
She wondered if Scip were very busy, and looking
about for him she heard an angry voice,
and then a child&#8217;s cry of pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s old man Lee,&#8221; she thought, and shrank
back trembling. Then remembering what Scip
had said of her bravery she walked slowly
forward trying to find courage to plead for
mercy.</p>

<p>A few steps showed her what was happening.
It was not old man Lee, however, whom she
saw administering discipline, but Scipio flogging
his little brother Tom. He was beating
him harshly, and as Hazel ran forward, without
timidity now, he gave him a kick. The
little fellow limped off, sobbing, and Scipio
turned to see Hazel coming toward him, her
eyes blazing, her hands clenched.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do that for?&#8221; she cried out.</p>

<p>&#8220;He sassed me,&#8221; Scipio answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a wicked, wicked boy,&#8221; Hazel said,
her voice shaking with excitement, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll
never speak to you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she turned and ran down the road,
leaving the lad staring speechless after her.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i130.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">She stopped to listen to the riot of song</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>All the joy had gone out of the spring. It
was a commonplace day and the sun made her
head ache.</p>

<p>Granny was surprised when, dinner over,
Hazel failed to go to her house among the pines.
The little girl had been as regular as if she
were already a teacher in a real school, and this
failure to keep her appointment boded something
serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;She don&#8217;t keep colored people&#8217;s time,&#8221;
Granny had said proudly to a neighbor; &#8220;she
done never forget the clock on the meeting-house
in Boston.&#8221; So when Hazel went to her
spinning-wheel and worked hard and nervously,
the old woman felt troubled but deemed it
best to say nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you walk a way with me, dearie?&#8221;
she said in the middle of the afternoon. &#8220;I&#8217;s
an errand and I&#8217;s pining for company.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel put on the pink sun-bonnet and together
they went down the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at that turkey-cock,&#8221; Granny said,
pointing to one in the field at their side. And
indeed he was a wonderful sight. Every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
feather stood out. His great tail was spread,
his body thrown back for his majestic stride.
Near him was the hen bird, indifferent to all
of his efforts to attract her attention. He went
up to her, beating his outstretched wings
upon the ground. He walked pompously about
her. Hazel forgot her trouble for a little in
watching him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s his courting,&#8221; said Granny. &#8220;He
can&#8217;t sing like the mocker, so he makes up with
his fine feathers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t care about him,&#8221; said Hazel,
and took no further interest in their walk.</p>

<p>A letter from her mother brightened things
a little the next morning. It was full of interesting
news, of going to the theatre, of the
church sale, and of Charity and her perplexities
over her school work. But what sunshine
the letter brought was clouded by the
last message: &#8220;Give my love to Scip.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she would never speak to him again!</p>

<p>She held to her resolve and stayed indoors
after dinner; but at four o&#8217;clock, when Scipio
surely would not be there, she ran up to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
house among the pines. Someone had visited
it before her. The cones were brushed away,
leaving the floor as she liked to have it, and in
the tin can that served as a vase were strange
wild flowers, the blossoms of the pitcher-plant.
How wonderful they were with their streaked
leaves! She had never seen them before.</p>

<p>Near the flowers was a piece of old paper
in which something was wrapped. Looking,
Hazel found bright birds&#8217; feathers: blue quills
from the jay, black iridescent crow&#8217;s feathers
and the rose-colored quills of the cardinal.
Someone must have been collecting them for
a long time.</p>

<p>Hazel counted the feathers, drew them,
one after another, across her cheek, feeling
their soft surfaces, played a little with the flowers
and then gathering the offerings together,
carried them soberly home. In her room she
pulled the little trunk out from under the bed
and placed the feathers carefully in the tray.
Then she locked the trunk, and pushed it back
in its place. Her precious possessions were
safe.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>She had received many presents in her short
life, but they had all been bought with money.
These gifts showed the patient toil by which
they had been purchased. She was glad she
had gone to the pines; she would accept
Scipio&#8217;s silent message and play with him again,
to-morrow.</p>

<p>Granny came in from the garden where she
had been at work. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to rain, sugar,&#8221;
she called. &#8220;We&#8217;d best build up the fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is my kitten indoors?&#8221; Hazel asked anxiously,
and ran down the road to find it playing
among some dry branches.</p>

<p>When she returned, the kitten in her arms,
the drops were already falling, and in a little
time the shower had settled into a steady
downpour.</p>

<p>&#8220;The rain will refresh the earth,&#8221; said Granny
wisely. &#8220;All the world will shine beautiful
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pleasant to hear the rain on the roof,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Hazel later, as she sipped the
cocoa that Granny had learned to make for
her, and ate her cornbread.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>Sometimes at supper they did not set any
table, but ate before the fire (just like a picnic,
Hazel would say) and they were sitting that
way to-night.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard the rain beat on the roof
until I came to Alabama,&#8221; Hazel said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
heard a great many new things, haven&#8217;t I,
but the most beautiful of all is the mocking
bird. What is it doing now out in the rain?
I should think it would be very wet?&#8221;</p>

<p>Granny laughed. &#8220;Its head is under its
wing and the water done run off its back. But
it likes it, honey, it don&#8217;t never take cold.
Listen how it&#8217;ll sing to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were silent for a minute, enjoying
the fire. Then Granny rose to her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone is outside,&#8221; she said; and moving
quickly, she threw open the door.</p>

<p>On the porch stood Scipio.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in, child,&#8221; she invited.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I&#8217;s wet and
soiled.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel ran to where he stood. &#8220;Come in,
oh, please come in, Scip,&#8221; she cried; and Scipio<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
stepped within the door while Granny went
back to the fire.</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s scanty clothing was soaked. He
would not advance into the room, but remained
with head bent, a heavy figure in the shadow.
He looked tired and the circles beneath his
eyes showed the need of sleep.</p>

<p>As he stood, hungry and ragged, he might
have embodied the patient laborer of his patient
race who for so long has planted the crop only
to see another reap the harvest.</p>

<p>Hazel caught her breath as she saw his
big lips tremble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Scip,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;it was mean
of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy looked up at her. &#8220;I know I&#8217;s
rough,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut that door, Scip,&#8221; Granny called out,
&#8220;and come in here. Never mind your clothes,
child. We&#8217;s had working folks here before,
and a little water won&#8217;t spoil this floor. Come
get warm and drink this cocoa. Our Boston
lady,&#8221; Granny said this with mock grandeur,
&#8220;she done try make me believe cocoa beats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
coffee; she don&#8217;t know everything yet, Scip.
But you can manage to drink the stuff, I
reckon. Set here now, on this stool, close to
the blaze. Don&#8217;t act like you thought you&#8217;d
outen the fire. Hazel, pass that cornbread and
give Scip a big plate for himself. Our guests
always has big plates. And you, Scip, do your
best by the bananas we boughten yesterday.
Our Boston lady thinks they&#8217;s mighty fine, and
the Lord certainly done do them up in pretty
yellow husks. See me shell one, Scip.&#8221; And so
Granny talked on until Scip, with his big plate
on his lap, seated by the warm fire, felt at home.</p>

<p>When supper was over Granny made the
shadows on the wall that Hazel loved, and
after she was through Scip made still cleverer
ones, Hazel thought. Then they all sat very
still while Hazel recited poetry and read out
of the book the minister gave her. It was a
jolly evening.</p>

<p>When Scipio had said good-night, and with
many invitations to come again, had gone
out into the rain, Hazel brought the pitcher-plants
in to her grandmother.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>&#8220;Do they grow near here?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they come from the swamp, three
miles south.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I quarrelled with Scipio, Granny,&#8221; Hazel
pursued, her cheeks hot, &#8220;because I saw him
beat his little brother Tom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom ain&#8217;t good for much,&#8221; said Granny
dryly. &#8220;He&#8217;s lazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s so little,&#8221; Hazel pleaded. She
put down the flowers and, stooping, picked up
the kitten playing on the hearth. &#8220;He&#8217;s little,
like a kitten.&#8221;</p>

<p>Granny smiled sadly as she replied: &#8220;I&#8217;s
afraid the children here has to learn to catch
mice mighty young. Scip has worked ever
since he could toddle to the cotton fields. He
thinks Tom might naturally help him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They ought both to be at play,&#8221; Hazel
said with a little catch in her breath. &#8220;You
said so this morning. It&#8217;s spring.&#8221;</p>

<small>CHOOSING A BIRTHDAY</small></h2>
</div>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Monday&#8217;s child is fair of face;</div>
<div class="verse">Tuesday&#8217;s child is full of grace;</div>
<div class="verse">Wednesday&#8217;s child is happy and glad;</div>
<div class="verse">Thursday&#8217;s child is sour and sad;</div>
<div class="verse">Friday&#8217;s child is loving in giving;</div>
<div class="verse">And Saturday&#8217;s child must work for its living.</div>
<div class="verse">But the child that is born on the Sabbath day</div>
<div class="verse">Is blithe and bonnie and good and gay.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">I was</span> born on Tuesday. What day were
you born on, Granny?&#8221; Hazel asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;What day was I born on, sugar? I don&#8217;t
know the year I was born on much less the
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Granny,&#8221; said Hazel, startled,
&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you a birthday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I has, child. But I knows no
more when I come into the world than I knows
when the Lord &#8217;ll take me out of it. You see,
I was sold down here when I was about four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
year old. That I knows. I can recollect
when I first come here. The violets were
blooming, and my mistress clapped her hands
when she see me picking the little blossoms.
That were in the spring of &#8217;46. But whether
I were just four, or most five, or only three
maybe, I don&#8217;t rightly know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Granny saw the tears standing in Hazel&#8217;s
eyes. &#8220;Your mother?&#8221; the child said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We never found one another; and there&#8217;s
thousands like that. Every day in the year
there was children sent from their folks to the
bottom lands. But don&#8217;t think about it, sugar.
It ain&#8217;t no use fretting about what&#8217;s past.
Howsomever, that&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t tell whether
I&#8217;s a Monday or a Tuesday or a Saturday
child. The Lord alone can reckon my days.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Hazel had finished the dishes she
went out-of-doors to think over what she had
heard. The story of the past stirred her
deeply, but had it not also a present import?
Granny had never had a birthday, had never
known what it was to be the centre of a birthday
party, to have a cake with candles, most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
of all to have the proud feeling that here was
a day that belonged to her alone. Could nothing
be done about it?</p>

<p>Hazel looked up at the clear blue sky and
about her at the riot of flowers. What a
beautiful time of year for a birthday! So
much better than her month of November.
Why not give Granny a birthday now?</p>

<p>&#8220;Scip,&#8221; Hazel called excitedly as he met
her on the hillside that afternoon. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to give Granny a birthday party. Will you
help?&#8221; And she explained Granny&#8217;s condition.</p>

<p>Scipio listened attentively, only half understanding,
for birthdays had never been celebrated
in the Lee household. But, of course,
he promised to help if Hazel would show him
the way; and before they went to their books
ways and means were already devised by Hazel&#8217;s
active mind.</p>

<p>That afternoon the little girl was a long
time writing her home letter. Some explanation
was necessary, and then the admonition
to please send them, quick, quick, and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
many dozen as she thought right. &#8220;Pink
and green and blue and yellow and white,
please, like the candles I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next question was, who should come
to the party?</p>

<p>&#8220;Only children, I think, Scip,&#8221; Hazel said
as she discussed it with him. &#8220;If I didn&#8217;t
ask all the grown people those left out would be
offended, wouldn&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon there might be trouble,&#8221; Scip
answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be you and Tom and Theora&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough for we-all,&#8221; said Scip as he
saw Hazel hesitate. &#8220;Jule can stay home
and work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel sighed, but felt relieved. It would
be well to have the guests very young so that
she could handle them.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Mammy Smith&#8217;s little girl, and Carrie
and Johnnie Hunt, that will be enough, and
I&#8217;ll teach them songs and games.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were busy days next week. Hazel
drilled the little country children, who looked
shyly at her and understood nothing of what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
she was saying. Hazel called them stupid
many times in her heart and sometimes with
her lips, but they were only unfamiliar with
all that she was trying to put into their lives.
But one thing was sure. They could sing
the birthday verse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a little box for you, honey,&#8221; Granny
said one morning, handing Hazel a package.
&#8220;Come by the post,&#8221; and she eyed it curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s a secret just now,&#8221; Hazel stammered.</p>

<p>&#8220;A secret? Well, child, don&#8217;t you tell it
until you is good and ready,&#8221; and Granny
went to her work in the garden.</p>

<p>In her room Hazel opened the box. It
contained six dozen little candles, pink and
green and blue and yellow and white. Just
what she wanted. Mother always did exactly
right.</p>

<p>But now, most difficult of all, to make the
cake!</p>

<p>Granny loved to cook in the old way over
the fire, but she had a stove in an outhouse
which she used now that the warm weather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
had come. If Hazel could get access to this,
without Granny&#8217;s knowing it, she would make
and try to bake the cake. At home she did
the mixing and her mother the baking. But
would Granny go away long enough for her
to do her work? There was the great difficulty.</p>

<p>On the day after the candles came, however,
it was solved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Ellen,&#8221; a breathless boy called, rushing
into the cabin in the morning, &#8220;Ma&#8217;s sick
and wants you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Aunt Ellen went at once and left Hazel
alone.</p>

<p>When the cake was baked and frosted Hazel
looked at it with mingled delight and distrust.
It had risen, but had it not fallen since?
She must not taste it to find out. It was
made of sugar and flour and eggs and it had
been beaten until her hand and arm were
first prickly, and then stiff with fatigue. It
ought to be light. And anyway it was round
and had white icing; certainly it was a beautiful
<i>looking</i> birthday cake.</p>

<p>Hazel put it carefully in the bottom of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
trunk. The party she decided should be on
the morrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter with you, child?&#8221;
Granny said the next day as they sat down
to dinner. &#8220;You&#8217;s as restless as a bird, and
you ain&#8217;t eating more&#8217;n a bird would eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you going to teach Scip?&#8221; she said
later, when Hazel failed to take her books
and papers and climb the hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scip can&#8217;t come to-day, Granny, he said
so. Let me help you.&#8221; And Hazel began
to straighten things in the room. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
we sweep a little?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old woman was clearly puzzled but she
helped Hazel with the work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s dress up and pretend it&#8217;s Christmas,&#8221;
Hazel exclaimed when three o&#8217;clock came.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll put on my white dress and you put on your
new calico.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;s got to work, child,&#8221; Granny said a little
severely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t work this afternoon,&#8221; Hazel
cried jumping up and down. &#8220;Play with me,
won&#8217;t you please play with me? I do want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
you to play with me, Granny, just one day.&#8221;
And before four o&#8217;clock Hazel had her way and
the two were sitting in their best gowns.
&#8220;Much like fools,&#8221; Granny said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be back in a moment,&#8221; Hazel cried
suddenly, and ran from the cabin door down
the road. Granny waited a minute or two
and then went to the porch to look out. Coming
up the road was a little procession led by
Hazel, with Scipio in the rear; between were
three little girls and two little boys. They
all marched solemnly to the porch where
Granny stood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; commanded Hazel, and the children
sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Happy birthday to you,</div>
<div class="verse">Happy birthday to you.</div>
<div class="verse">Happy birthday, Aunt Ellen,</div>
<div class="verse">Happy birthday to you.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Granny looked the children over; but she
did not ask them in.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your birthday, Granny,&#8221; Hazel said,
her voice shaking with excitement. &#8220;I chose
to-day for your birthday.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>The old woman glanced at Hazel without
smiling and held herself very erect. She felt
that they were making game of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretend party,&#8221; Hazel tried to explain;
but as she looked into Granny&#8217;s eyes she suddenly
wanted to cry.</p>

<p>The little children stood quietly, waiting
to be told what to do next.</p>

<p>Then Scipio stepped forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Ellen,&#8221; he said in his slow way,
&#8220;it&#8217;s like this; you&#8217;s been kind to we-all
here. There&#8217;s many of us as you&#8217;s helped
into the world like you did Mrs. Brown&#8217;s
baby yesterday. We wants to do something
for you, so we&#8217;s just come and we&#8217;s brought
you some flowers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The five waiting children looked at Hazel.
She nodded, and they stepped forward and each
gave a bouquet to Granny.</p>

<p>The old woman&#8217;s face softened as Scipio
spoke, and now she smiled kindly and asked
the children in. As they entered she noticed
that each one was decked out a little, and she
glanced at her own dress and then at Hazel&#8217;s.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>&#8220;She&#8217;s a smart one,&#8221; she thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;May we play a game, Granny?&#8221; Hazel
asked hesitatingly. Scipio had seemingly saved
the day, but she must make no further mistakes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you sit here by the hearth, Granny,
and Scip with you, and we&#8217;ll act a charade.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took the children out on the porch and
presently they came in, each on hands and feet,
and meowed with persistence if not with fervor.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s meant to be a word, Granny and
Scip, can you guess what it is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cats,&#8221; said Granny.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; Hazel cried, clapping her
hands. &#8220;<i>Cat.</i> You guessed right the first
time, didn&#8217;t you? Now we act the next word.&#8221;</p>

<p>She skipped out of the room with the children
onto the porch. She was beginning to feel
like herself. Granny smoothed her dress complacently.</p>

<p>Presently two boys came in and stood across
the room each holding the end of a long string.
A third child, a girl with an apron on, walked
solemnly forward and fastened a towel to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
string with a clothes-pin. Immediately Hazel,
with a dark shawl stretched out at arms-length
to look like wings, hopped up and
nipped off the nose of the maid, who gave a
very creditable sob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Along came a black-bird and nipped off
her nose,&#8221; the two boys said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a little word,&#8221; explained Hazel, &#8220;and
if you put it with cat it makes a longer word.&#8221;</p>

<p>Granny and Scip listened in silence; a charade
seemed outside their mental horizon.</p>

<p>But Hazel and her troupe acted the whole
word with studied care, and five little cats
rolled about ecstatically in the green stuff
Hazel threw to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knows it, Hazel,&#8221; Scipio cried suddenly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s <i>Catnip</i>. You make it like you learn
me words.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel beamed at him. He had pleased his
little teacher to-day more than he could ever
have hoped to please her in all his life. This
might be Granny&#8217;s pretend birthday, but it
was a real day of triumph for Hazel&#8217;s pretend
brother.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>&#8220;And now, Granny,&#8221; Hazel said, still a little
tremulously, &#8220;would you go on the porch with
the children for just a few minutes and shut
the door and leave Scipio and me here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Granny went willingly enough. She was
beginning to enter into the spirit of the game.</p>

<p>&#8220;Darken the room as much as you can,
Scip. Well put it in the middle of the table,
and the candles on it and around it, and the
flowers about them. We must light them,
quickly, quickly. Oh, Scip, Scip, see! It&#8217;s
the beautifulest kind of a birthday cake when
you have seventy candles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her come in right now,&#8221; Scipio said.</p>

<p>Granny with the children entered the room.
On the table was a big white cake. Candles
were in it and candles were around it, two rows
deep. Each little flame twinkled as it rose
from the bright-colored wax. It was a lovely
sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you done do, sugar?&#8221; Granny gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a birthday cake for you, Granny. I
wanted you so to have a birthday cake. I&#8217;ve
had five that I can remember, but they&#8217;re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
prettiest when you&#8217;re seventy. I wanted you
so to have a birthday that I chose one for
you; and April is a nice time, don&#8217;t you think?
You do like it, don&#8217;t you, Granny?&#8221; and Hazel
ran to her grandmother&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Baby,&#8221; Granny said holding her tight.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the most beautiful thing as ever was.
It&#8217;s the prettiest sight these eyes has ever
seen. Scip,&#8221; she called suddenly, &#8220;don&#8217;t you
let those candles burn down. Everybody&#8217;s
got to see my cake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, Granny,&#8221; Hazel said when the
candles were blown out, &#8220;you must cut the
cake for the children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut the cake for them tricks,&#8221; Granny
cried excitedly. &#8220;No, indeed. The children
can have corn-pone. Everybody has got to
see my birthday cake. Where did you buy
it, honey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I made it,&#8221; Hazel answered, and that completed
Granny&#8217;s amazement and Hazel&#8217;s happiness.</p>

<p>The children had their corn-pone, with
jelly on it, and the cake was left on the table.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
News of this wonder soon reached the community,
and the first visitors came that evening.
For one week the sight lasted. Twelve
times did the candles, for a brief space, shine
out on the white icing and brighten the flowers.
The cake was not moved from the table, but
remained there day and night, and the kitten
was kept rigidly indoors to frighten away any
possible mouse. At length, when the candles
had burned to their sockets, Granny cut through
the icing and gave a slice to Hazel and one to
herself.</p>

<p>Hazel ate and said nothing, but she was
glad it had not been cut before. Staleness
might seem to account in part for the very
heavy character of the half-cooked dough.</p>

<p>But Granny ate her piece as if it had been
ambrosia, the food of the gods.</p>

<p>&#8220;That are splendid cake,&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;That icing are as sweet as you are, sugar,
and I can&#8217;t say more.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she took another slice.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>GOOD-BYE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Granny</span>, please help me to weave once
more,&#8221; said Hazel, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll have a good big
piece of cotton cloth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ever since Hazel had spun the cotton she
had wanted to weave it, but her grandmother&#8217;s
loom was too large for her to handle. Granny
had solved the difficulty by saying they could
do it together, Hazel throwing the shuttle
while she pushed the frame. In this fashion
they had woven their cloth. &#8220;It&#8217;s your work,
honey,&#8221; Granny had insisted. &#8220;You&#8217;re doing
the weaving, not me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it hot!&#8221; Hazel said, after they had
worked for an hour. &#8220;April in the South is
as warm as June at home. Is it hotter than
this in the summer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect it is,&#8221; said Granny, looking at the
child&#8217;s moist curls. &#8220;Don&#8217;t do any more now.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>They went out on the porch to get cool.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought a great deal about my weaving,&#8221;
said Hazel, very seriously, &#8220;and, Granny,
I&#8217;ve decided to cut some of the cloth into wash-rags
so that I can make presents to a number of
my friends. I can hem them, can&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dearie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then I shall make ten pieces at least.
Granny, who is that coming down the road?&#8221;</p>

<p>Granny stood up and saw a young white
lady coming toward them on horseback, who
pulled up her horse as she reached the porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Hazel Tyler live here?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Hazel replied, going out to her, &#8220;I
am Hazel Tyler.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know your minister,&#8221; said the young
lady, smiling, &#8220;and he asked me to come to
see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel&#8217;s heart swelled with pride. The young
lady dismounted, tied her horse, and then,
declining to go indoors, sat on the steps with
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid you won&#8217;t like my errand,
Mrs. Tyler,&#8221; the new-comer said, &#8220;but I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
come to ask Hazel if she wishes to go home
with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t have come on a less welcome
errand to me,&#8221; said Granny sadly, &#8220;but
the hot days is coming, and I suppose the
child must go North again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young lady, whose name was Miss
Davis, then explained that she came from Boston,
that she taught in the Jonesville school,
and that she should return to her home the
middle of May. &#8220;And if that will be convenient
for Hazel,&#8221; she concluded, &#8220;she can
go by rail all the way with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If my mother tells me it is what she wants
me to do,&#8221; Hazel said, &#8220;of course I would love
to travel with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think from your minister&#8217;s letter, that you
will hear shortly from your mother,&#8221; answered
Miss Davis, and went into the details of the
journey.</p>

<p>Hazel learned that if she were in company
with a white person she might ride in the
Pullman car and sleep in the fascinating bed
that pulled down from the top. She would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
only be traveling two days, and her mother
would be at the end of the journey. But
Granny! She did not want to look in her
direction as she talked with Miss Davis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t she pretty?&#8221; she asked the old
woman as their visitor trotted down the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see as she was well-favored,&#8221;
Granny answered.</p>

<p>Hazel put her arms about her grandmother&#8217;s
neck. &#8220;I don&#8217;t leave for three weeks,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;and I&#8217;m coming back again. Why,
Granny, I truly do love the South. At least,
the part where you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You dear baby,&#8221; was Granny&#8217;s only answer.</p>

<p>When Scip heard the news among the pines
that afternoon, he started as though Hazel
had struck him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who going to take you?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Hazel explained about Miss Davis, and the
comfort of the train. Scipio could find no
fault, but remained silent watching a redbird
that hopped fearlessly about among their books
on the ground. They had made a pet of this
cardinal, scattering food for him, and making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
bird sounds in conversation which Hazel insisted
he could understand. When she had
finished talking, the bird flew to a bough near
them and began his clear, sweet song.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is asking you to stay,&#8221; Scip said.</p>

<p>He felt like crying.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to my mother, Scip,&#8221; Hazel
said softly.</p>

<p>After a little pause she went on: &#8220;I&#8217;ll write
letters to you. See, I&#8217;ll make you a plain
copy of written letters. I&#8217;ll make it very plain.
You&#8217;ve only learned to print, Scip, but these
next three weeks you must learn about writing.&#8221;
And glad to have something definite to do,
the little teacher turned to her task with earnest
persistence and the matter of departure
was not spoken of again.</p>

<p>But it hung over the three weeks. The
mocking bird&#8217;s morning song now had a note
of sadness. &#8220;You&#8217;re going away,&#8221; he said.
The hen was reproachful as she showed her
chickens. &#8220;You won&#8217;t see them grow up,&#8221;
she clucked. Pussy Lucy purred, &#8220;You can&#8217;t
play with me when I get to be a cat.&#8221; And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
even the pigs grunted, &#8220;Why do you leave
our babies now that they are so cunning?&#8221;
for spring had glorified the pigs that fathered
and mothered dear little offspring.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are so many things to say good-bye
to,&#8221; Hazel said to Granny one night.</p>

<p>As for Granny, she was openly heart-broken.
&#8220;You&#8217;s been the light of this house,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and the sun done drop out of my sky when
you leave me. But I don&#8217;t blame your mother
for calling you, not one speck.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first of May, Hazel began to pack her
trunk. But there were certain possessions that
went in and out with her changing mood.
What books should she leave for Scip?</p>

<p>Scip had nothing to read. That she knew,
and meant to leave him some of her little
library, but how much?</p>

<p>She had six books which she kept on a shelf
in her room. The first was a New Testament
given her by her father. Of that there was
no question; it was hers for ever and ever.
The second was a simple reader that she fortunately
had brought and had used in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
lessons. Of course, that would go to Scip.
The third was the dictionary. Scip should
have that, for Mother would be glad to give
it to him. The fourth was &#8220;What Katy did,&#8221;
a girl&#8217;s book, that she knew Scip wouldn&#8217;t
care for; it could go in the trunk. The fifth
and sixth were the Jungle Book, and Child
Life, the Christmas gift of her minister.</p>

<p>When the first week of May came to an end,
it seemed probable that the Jungle Book would
remain on the shelf. Scipio did not fully appreciate
it&mdash;it was evident he thought some of
the conversation silly&mdash;but he liked the pictures,
especially the one of the tiger. Hazel
adored the Jungle Book, but, though she knew
she should not count on this, she guessed
shrewdly that when Mr. Perkins learned of
her generosity he would give her another
copy. But Child Life was different. And for
many days it seemed that Child Life would
remain in the trunk.</p>

<p>Hazel was an only child, and she had had few
serious calls upon her generosity. Pretty things
had been given her, and she had been genuinely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
grateful, but she had come imperceptibly
to regard them as her right. Never in
her life had she given away anything for which
she deeply cared. And she cared deeply for
this book of poems. But Scip cared for them,
too, and knew some of them almost by heart.
Such a book would help him in his reading
very much.</p>

<p>She had told Granny about the Boston
library, where you could get any book in the
world. Of course, it would have Child Life.
But it was one thing to get a book for two weeks
from a library, and another to have it on your
book shelf every month of the year for your
very own. And then, this book had her name
in it, written by her minister. She hugged it
close. It would not be right to give away the
minister&#8217;s present. And feeling a little like
a hypocrite she put it back in the trunk.</p>

<p>That afternoon she impressed upon Scipio
that he must write to her. She had spoken
of it before, but he had said nothing. &#8220;You
really must write, Scip. You can print now
quite nicely, you know. It will be good practice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
for you, and I shall want to hear. You
will, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Scipio shook his head.</p>

<p>Hazel felt disappointed and angry. &#8220;You
must, Scip. Why won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave his reason. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t got no money,
and they won&#8217;t give stamps at the store.&#8221;</p>

<p>When she went home Hazel took Child
Life out of the trunk and put it, almost
savagely, on her table. &#8220;It&#8217;s a wicked shame,&#8221;
she said to herself. &#8220;He works and works
and he can&#8217;t have one single thing.&#8221; She
took her pen, dipped it in the ink, and turning
to the title page wrote under her own
name, &#8220;To Scipio Lee.&#8221;</p>

<p>When she was done she looked at it hard
and winked the tears from her eyes. Then
she placed it on the shelf with the primer
and the dictionary and the Jungle Book.</p>

<p>&#8220;Granny, will you write to me when I leave
here?&#8221; she asked that night as they sat on the
porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sugar; but you mustn&#8217;t be surprised
at my kind of writing. Colored children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
weren&#8217;t taught to read and write in slavery
days, but your father he learned me. When
he were about twelve he began. &#8216;It may be
I done leave home and mammy by and by,&#8217;
he said, &#8216;and I wants to get letters from my
mother.&#8217; So he worked with me every day
like you work with Scip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember the letters you wrote. Father
loved them. I would understand what they
were about now. So you&#8217;ll surely write me,&#8221;
she went on persistently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, honey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, Granny, will you let Scip put his
letters inside of yours, because he hasn&#8217;t money
to buy stamps?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I sure will, you dear child.&#8221;</p>

<p>It had been arranged that Miss Davis should
call for Hazel the Monday morning after her
school closed and should take her to the station.
She was to come at ten o&#8217;clock. The
day before, Sunday, Scipio, on Granny&#8217;s and
Hazel&#8217;s urgent invitation, took supper with
them. The boy felt more conscious of his
ill-kept clothes within doors than when with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
Hazel in the woods, but she had been persistent
and he had come. She took him into
her room and showed him the shelf with its
four books.</p>

<p>&#8220;I give them to you,&#8221; she said solemnly,
and put them in his arms.</p>

<p>He looked bewildered. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t leaving
all these for me?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>She nodded, &#8220;Yes, they&#8217;ve got your name
in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t have &#8217;em,&#8221; he said, almost crying.
&#8220;I ain&#8217;t any place to keep &#8217;em. The boys
is worse than ever now you don&#8217;t let me lick
&#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel was dumb for a moment. Then she
called Granny to her.</p>

<p>The old woman appeared in the doorway
and the situation was explained to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could Scip keep the books here on this
shelf?&#8221; Hazel asked. &#8220;Then they would be
quite safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, in course,&#8221; Granny replied heartily.
&#8220;And maybe he&#8217;ll read aloud sometimes to
me. We could make them out together.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to know how to read,&#8221; Scip said
resolutely. &#8220;I never had nothing to read
before, but now I&#8217;ve got books and a dictionary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel read to them for a long time that evening;
it was easier than to talk. She read
the favorite poem of each; for Granny, &#8220;The
Hen with One Chicken,&#8221; who thought she
was so much busier than the ducks and turkeys
with their broods; for Scip, &#8220;The Night
with a Wolf,&#8221; &#8220;The Captain&#8217;s Daughter,&#8221;
and the one she, too, liked so much, of the
little girl in the woods.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Are you not often, little maid,</div>
<div class="verse">Beneath the sighing trees afraid?&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And the little girl&#8217;s answer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Afraid, beneath the tall, strong trees,</div>
<div class="verse">That bend their arms to shelter me?&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; Hazel said confidentially,
&#8220;I used to be a little frightened in the woods,
but I never am now. I think of the poem
and I have Scip&#8217;s stick!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming again,&#8221; she said to Scip as he
went down the porch to his home. &#8220;I&#8217;m coming
again,&#8221; and she repeated it often to Granny
before she went to bed.</p>

<p>Miss Davis arrived in a carriage the next
morning on the front seat with the driver,
her trunk behind. Hazel&#8217;s was placed beside
it, and then the child turned to say good-bye.</p>

<p>Scipio was there with Theora and Tom hanging
shyly to their big brother. He was very
gentle with them. Hazel kissed both the
children good-bye, and put out her hand to
Scip.</p>

<p>He took it and said softly, &#8220;Good-bye,
Sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>Granny held her close and could not let
her go. &#8220;You&#8217;s been the light of my house,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Tell your mother I bless her for
letting me have you. And I send you
back to her sound and well, honey. She&#8217;ll be
full of happiness. But we-all &#8217;ll miss you
sorely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel could only give her one more hug.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
Then she scrambled to the seat between the
driver and Miss Davis, and the horse started
off.</p>

<p>When she looked back she saw Granny standing
in the road, her hand on Scipio&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<small>HOME</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was necessary to stay in Montgomery
over night in order to make railroad connections;
so Hazel was able to visit Mr. and Mrs.
Jenks again, while Miss Davis went to a hotel.
Mrs. Jenks and her husband were delighted
at the change in Hazel&#8217;s appearance. The
thin, shy child had grown almost plump and
was full of spirits. She talked gaily at dinner,
she romped with the children, and she gave
her host such a generous good-night hug that
he was breathless and disheveled when it was
over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; Hazel called as she ran upstairs,
&#8220;but that is the way Mr. Perkins likes
me to say good-night to him. And, oh,&#8221;
ecstatically, &#8220;I shall see him next Sunday!&#8221;</p>

<p>The following morning Mrs. Jenks put up
an enormous box of luncheons and breakfasts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
and suppers for Hazel. Such a quantity of
bread and butter sandwiches, such a lot of
sliced chicken and hard-boiled eggs, and a jar
of guava jelly with a spoon that didn&#8217;t have to
be returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be less expensive for you than to
get your meals on the train,&#8221; Mrs. Jenks began
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>Hazel broke in impetuously, &#8220;I know all
about it, Mrs. Jenks. I&#8217;m not wanted in the
dining car because I&#8217;m colored. I&#8217;m traveling
North as Miss Davis&#8217;s maid, and I&#8217;m to do little
things for her and to play I really am a maid.
She says her traveling dress hooks up the
back and around the side with about a hundred
hooks, and that she could never wear it except
for me. And I must keep her hair smooth for
her because her mother says it is always untidy&mdash;it
isn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s beautiful. And I&#8217;m to fan
the flies away from her when she takes a nap.
As if I thought flies were on trains! But
we are going to play that I am her maid, to
make a game of it, because it is better to do
that than to keep feeling angry. How many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
meals do I eat? One, two, three, four, five?
This is plenty, for I can get milk and cocoa.
I&#8217;m going to sleep in an upper berth, think,
and climb up on a ladder! It will be great
fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Jenks smiled and sighed and put some
cakes in the box.</p>

<p>Miss Davis called for Hazel in a carriage,
and the little girl felt very proud as she drove
away with her new friend. The station was
an exciting place. Hazel saw a check marked
&#8220;Boston&#8221; put on her trunk and knew that
home was near. She entered the Pullman
car with Miss Davis and held her hand tightly
as the porter showed them their seats. All
her safety from insult, she knew, lay in the
presence of her white companion. They sat
down together and at length the train drew
out of the station, headed for the North and
home.</p>

<p>The little girl looked up at her friend. &#8220;I&#8217;m
trying to think all the time of Mother,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;but I can&#8217;t forget Granny and Scip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll visit them again,&#8221; Miss Davis said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
consolingly. &#8220;When people once begin to travel
they never stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>The journey was full of interest to Hazel,
and not an unkind word was said to her during
the trip. Indeed, an old lady in the seat across
the aisle took a fancy to her, and sent her a
big plate of ice-cream from the dining car.
&#8220;Two portions, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; Miss Davis said
when she heard about it. New York was
reached, a din of trolleys and elevateds and
a big, beautiful station with a restaurant
where everyone could sit and eat, and then
Boston and home.</p>

<p>It was night when they got off the train at
the South Station, and Hazel trembled as she
walked by Miss Davis&#8217;s side. If Mother should
miss her! Then she saw a big black man and
she rushed toward and past him and into her
mother&#8217;s arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;I waited a long time for my greeting,&#8221; said
Mr. Perkins, smoothing his coat collar, &#8220;but
it was satisfactory when I got it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Miss Davis?&#8221; asked Hazel when
she could look about her again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>&#8220;She left her good-bye,&#8221; said Mr. Perkins;
&#8220;she was hurrying to meet someone, too;
perhaps it was her brother, and perhaps it
wasn&#8217;t. Come, Little Frog, give me your
check. I&#8217;ll look after your trunk when I&#8217;ve
put you and your mother on the car. You&#8217;re
coming to dine with us Sunday.&#8221;</p>

<p>How beautiful home looked with its three
dear little rooms! The table was set for supper.
There was a big dish of strawberries, white
bread and butter, and a spider on the fire with
a lamb chop in it ready to cook! In a moment
Charity came in.</p>

<p>The two little girls flew into one another&#8217;s
arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, ain&#8217;t you fat, Hazel!&#8221; said Charity.</p>

<p>Hazel laughed delightedly. &#8220;I like to be
fat,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to cook your chop,&#8221; said Charity,
and Mrs. Tyler let her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said Hazel as she ate her supper,
&#8220;you don&#8217;t know, for you haven&#8217;t been South,
how good this chop tastes. There are two
things I don&#8217;t want to see again for a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
time; one is bacon and the other is corn bread.&#8221;
Then, feeling that this might seem ungrateful
to Granny, &#8220;they are both good, but I&#8217;ve had
enough of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a moving-picture show around the
corner,&#8221; said Charity, when Hazel had finished
her supper, &#8220;want to go? I&#8217;ve got two dimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, not to-night, Charity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, whenever you want, the price is on
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel was not allowed to help with the dishes,
for she was a visitor this evening. To-morrow
she would slip back into the routine of home.
She and her mother talked and talked far into
the night, there was so much to tell about,
and both were so happy. At length Hazel
dropped off to sleep, but her mother lay awake
until the dawn showed her her child&#8217;s face
again. &#8220;How well she looks,&#8221; Mrs. Tyler
said again and again to herself. &#8220;I did right
to send her away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is a wash-cloth that I spun and wove
for you, Charity,&#8221; Hazel said the next morning
and handed it triumphantly to her friend.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>Charity looked it over carefully. &#8220;I can
buy &#8217;em like that for five cents at Jordan,
Marsh&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you?&#8221; answered Hazel, trying not to
be hurt. &#8220;And it took me days and days to
make it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Charity loftily, &#8220;didn&#8217;t I tell
you it was slow down South?&#8221;</p>

<p>When Hazel took the same gift to her school-teacher,
however, she heard a very different
comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve done a wonderful thing, Hazel,&#8221;
Miss Grey said. &#8220;You&#8217;ve followed an industry
from its beginning to the finished product.
Next year, if it is possible, we will get a spinning-wheel
and loom and you can demonstrate the
spinning and weaving to the school.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel repeated this to Charity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bet you&#8217;d break your thread,&#8221; Charity
declared, &#8220;when you had to spin before all
the boys and girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>The homecoming was very exciting. There
was the first Sunday at church, and the Sunday
school service, when they wanted to hear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
about their song-books down in Alabama,
and the good time at the Perkins&#8217;s and the
trolley rides with Charity. Mr. Perkins gave
Hazel a dollar for trolley rides, telling her
that she must not forget the city and its
delights.</p>

<p>June came, and one late afternoon Mrs.
Tyler returned from her work looking so
happy that Hazel accused her of having a
secret.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tyler nodded assent. &#8220;You shall hear
it after supper,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>So when the dishes were washed they sat
down together, and Hazel heard the secret.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going away for the summer,&#8221; said
her mother. &#8220;I find I can make more money
at my shampooing in the country than here.
Some of my customers go to a beautiful place
by the sea and they promise me plenty of business
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it at Revere Beach?&#8221; asked Hazel.</p>

<p>&#8220;No indeed, goosey, much further than that,
&#8217;way down in Maine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More traveling?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>&#8220;Yes, more traveling, but not so far as
Alabama.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall miss Charity,&#8221; mused Hazel, &#8220;but
I believe wherever you go you have to miss
somebody. Are there pines in Maine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pines?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, pine trees. Do they grow there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, if there are pine trees, I shall like
it very much!&#8221;</p>

<p>Just before they left town letters came from
Granny and Scip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said Hazel after reading them,
&#8220;my heart is content. Scipio is living with
Granny; at least, he is staying there at night.
She never did like living alone, the least bit,
and so she got Scip&#8217;s father to let the boy stay
with her. She gives him supper and breakfast
and Granny says he was half starved
before, and at night they both read out of
the books I left. Granny says they think of
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scipio&#8217;s letter was plainly printed and showed
constant consultation with the dictionary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Dear Sister:</p>

<p>Aunt Ellen has took me in.</p>

<p>I am going to help her pick cotton when it ripes.</p>

<p>The cat is playing by the fire.</p>

</div>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you trimmed my summer hat
with the feathers Scip gave me, Mother,&#8221;
Hazel said, &#8220;I shall tell him about it the next
time I write.&#8221;</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
